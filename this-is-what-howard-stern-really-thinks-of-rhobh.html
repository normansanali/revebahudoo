As for the Real Housewives, Howard actually loathes almost all of the incarnations and spin-offs of the show... except Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Howard Stern Thinks He Ruined His Vacation With Emily Blunt And Jimmy Kimmel</a></span></p><p>Even though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Howard loves watching superhero movies</a>, he and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> his wife of 20 years, Beth</a>, bond over their love/hate relationship with reality TV. And to say that Howard love/hates RHOBH would be an understatement. While the self-proclaimed 'King of All Media' is an incredibly dedicated viewer of Kyle Richards, Sutton Stracke, and the rest of the Beverly Hills Housewives, he has some very real disdain for them. Here's how he really feels about it all...</p><h2 id=howard-s-relationship-with-the-beverly-hills-housewives>Howard's Relationship With The Beverly Hills Housewives</h2><p>Howard has a complicated relationship with the Beverly Hills Housewives. Even though he's a VERY active viewer of the hit reality show, he's been vocal about some of the elements of the show he hates. On top of this, he's also had a number of the Housewives as guests on his show. This creates a somewhat complicated dynamic for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless, Howard is an addict of RHOBH.</p><p>Since Howard talks about The Real Housewives of Beverley Hills on his satellite radio show, it often alienates some of his fans who wouldn't watch the show if they were paid to. On top of this, not all of Howard's colleagues are into the show. This includes Howard's co-host, Robin Quivers.</p><p>"I don't like any of the other Real Housewives. Only Real Housewives of Beverly Hills," Howard claimed during <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a May 19, 2021 episode of his show</a>.</p><p>"They're not real housewives!" Robin&nbsp;exclaimed.</p><p>"No. Stop it! Don't ruin it for me!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘RHOBH’: Inside Teddi Mellencamp’s Firing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-housewives-are-obnoxious-and-infantile-according-to-howard>The Housewives Are 'Obnoxious' And 'Infantile', According To Howard</h2><p>"You know why I love them?" Howard told Robin and his audience. "I have never seen more obnoxious people in my life. These wealthy women and they love showing off their wealth. I was always told to people should be humble. These women, they open up their closest and they're there with the shoes and the bags and they never say to themselves, 'Can you imagine some poor person struggling, making minimum wage, watching me with all of my possessions?' It never occurs to them to say, 'Jesus! This looks obnoxious. It looks infantile, the way we fight."</p><p>The fact that Howard hates so much about the stars of the show is what's entertaining to him. But that doesn't mean he likes that about himself.</p><p>The discussion about Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills continued <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on June 7th</a> when Robin asked Howard if he had seen a Hulu documentary on Erika Jayne. While Howard hadn't yet seen the documentary of the RHOBH star and her controversial husband, he once again claimed that he loved the latest season of the show... even though it bothers him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's real good this season, isn't it J.D.? Beverly Hills Housewives. Holy s***!" Howard said to his colleague, J.D. Harmeyer, who also loves reality television. "Those girls are so clueless, man. They show off their wealth... They're in Tahoe now in this beautiful place. And the whole time I'm laying in bed going, 'Can you believe these women? They don't deserve this kind of luxury. What the f*** did they do?' And [Beth] goes 'Shhh!'."</p><p>"Who deserves that kind of luxury?" Robin laughed.</p><p>"Not them! I'm sorry."</p><p>On top of this, Howard just can't understand why the women on the show get so much work done. He claimed that the surgeon who did Kyle Richard's nose job should be fired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Why would you get a nose job!? [Kyle] had a gorgeous nose!" Howard said. "[Then] Lisa Rinna has those gigantic lips and she thinks they look good. She's coming out with a lipstick. And I go crazy! I go, 'Why do I love this so much? They drive me nuts! But I gotta watch it! And then they put on outfits and they think they're sexy and they're not even sexy!"</p><p>"No!" Robin agreed.</p><p>"Then there's this woman, Sutton, on there who spends thousands of dollars on every outfit and she looks horrible!" Howard claimed. "What a waste of money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The general attitude of the housewives also irks Howard as he claims they believe they're more famous than they actually are. He even recalled how one of them (Countess LuAnn de Lesseps) once walked up to his table at a restaurant and just sat down and started talking. This is something Howard, who is legitimately extremely famous, would never do to any other famous person... ever.</p><p>Even though Howard has some major issues with how the Beverly Hills housewives he still is addicted to the show and really wants to get into why...</p><h2 id=howard-wants-to-talk-about-it-beth-doesn-t>Howard Wants To Talk About It... Beth Doesn't</h2><p>Howard then went on to describe how he constantly wants to have a discussion about what he's seeing on RHOBH while Beth just wants to watch the show. This is because the antics of the housewives drive him INSANE! He just doesn't understand it... and nor does Robin.</p><p>"How could you have a discussion?" Robin asked Howard. "They have the stupidest arguments. They get irritated over nothing. They're always gossiping about each other, then getting into trouble, then having to apologize."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Do Fans Really Feel About Season 11 Of ‘RHOBH’?</a></span></p><p>But Howard's point is precisely that... The fact that it's so stupid and obnoxious is what makes it worth talking about. Regardless of the reasoning, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has a major fan in Howard Stern.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Howard Stern Really Thought About The Royal Interview With Oprah</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edahmK1lmKTEor7DZqqtnaKjerOxwKWjsmWknbavt9Jmpp9lop28o7SO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./love-after-lockup-tracie-wagaman-jokes-about-her-muffin-top-calls-out-body-shamers-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tracie Wagaman Jokes About Her 'Muffin Top,' Calls Out Body Shamers">&larr;
