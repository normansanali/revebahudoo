Weinstein was born on March 19, 1952, in Flushing, New York. He grew up in New York City with a Jewish family. After finishing high school, he went to college at SUNY-Buffalo.</p><p>Harvey began a small independent film marketing company called Miramax in the late 1970s with his brother Bob.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The music group Miramax was named after their parents, Miriam and Max. The first films the company put out were mostly music-themed live films, like Paul McCartney’s Rockshow.</p><p>During the 1980s, the Weinsteins slowly built on this success by making independent films that got good reviews and did okay at the box office.</p><p>In 1988, more people learned about Harvey Weinstein and Miramax through the documentary The Thin Blue Line by Errol Morris. The film was about Randall Adams, a man on death row after being wrongfully accused.</p><h2><strong>Harvey Weinstein Religion</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Because his family is Jewish, Harvey Weinstein has always identified as a Jew.</p><h2><strong>Harvey Weinstein Ethnicity and Nationality</strong></h2><p>His family is Jewish, and his maternal grandparents immigrated from Poland.

His role as a co-founder of Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company is what brought him the most fame.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Since 2005, Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob have both served as co-chairmen of The Weinstein enterprise, which is the family’s film production enterprise. They have a total ownership of 42% of the firm between the two of them.</p><p>Harvey Weinstein was awarded an Academy Award for his work as a producer on the film Shakespeare in Love. He also received seven Tony Awards for his work as a producer on a number of award-winning plays and musicals, such as The Producers, Billy Elliot the Musical, and August: Osage County.</p><p>During their time running Miramax, they were responsible for producing a number of films, the most notable of which were Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, and Good Will Hunting.</p><p>During the time that they ran The Weinstein Company, the brothers were responsible for the production of a number of films, including The Imitation Game, The Butler, Inglorious Basterds, Silver Linings Playbook, and Django Unchained.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In appreciation of his numerous services to the film business in the United Kingdom, Harvey Weinstein was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the year 2004.

Weinstein worked hard to establish an image of being cutthroat and prone to outbursts of rage. It is said that he allegedly shoved a reporter from the New York Observer out the door of a party after putting him in a headlock.</p><p>During another incident, Weinstein publicly criticized filmmaker Julie Taymor and her husband because of a disagreement with a test screening of Taymor’s film Frida. It was said that he harassed Sydney Pollack when he was on his deathbed about the release of the movie The Reader.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Another contentious decision that Harvey Weinstein made was in 2009 when he openly stated his objection to the attempts that were being made to extradite Roman Polanski from Switzerland to the United States on the basis of the 1977 allegations of illicit sexual intercourse with a 13-year-old.</p><p>In 2013, the film critic for the New York Post, Kyle Smith, suggested that Harvey Weinstein had produced a number of films that were offensive to Catholics.
