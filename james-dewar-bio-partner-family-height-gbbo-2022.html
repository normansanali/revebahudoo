And this time, we have a nuclear scientist, James Dewar, who loves baking “child-friendly” horror-inspired style cakes.</span></p><p><span>Get to know him better as this James Dewar Bio proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>James Dewar On Great British Bake Off GBBO 2022</b></h3><p><i><span>The Great British Bake Off</span></i><span> season 13 premiered on September 13, 2022, after several changes to its programming schedule following the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.</span></p><p><span>So, as always, there appeared 12 new nervous hopefuls including James Dewar who took it to the kitchen to try and impress the judges: Dame Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood. And also, the plot remained the same — by the end of the first 90-minute episode, one contestant was crowned “Star Baker” while another was sent home.</span></p><p><span>All excited for the show’s premiere, James took it to his IG to share, “It’s official!!! I’ve joined the biggest, bakingest family ever!!! Watch me on the 13th of September on @channel4 as I do everything wrong on the @britishbakeoff”</span></p><p><span>However, he never imagined he’d make it onto the Channel 4 baking show. “To be honest, it still feels like a dream! I never thought I’d be considered and, now that I’ve met all the other bakers, still can’t believe I somehow made the cut – those bakers are crazy good,” he explained.</span></p><p><span>As for his game plan, James wanted to impress the judges with his signature “child-friendly horror” baked goods with adorable decorations. His choice of flavors included anything autumnal such as apples, caramel, and mixed spices.</span></p><p><span>He even named himself the “Red Velvet King.”</span></p><p><span>Joining James for the 13th installment of GBBO were his co-stars — <a href=#>Dawn</a> (IT manager), Janusz (personal assistant to a head teacher), Kevin (music teacher), Maisam (baker), Abdul (baker), Maxy (architectural assistant), Rebs (baker), Sandro (baker), Carole (supermarket cashier), Syabria (baker), and Will (DIY enthusiast and former charity boss).</span></p><h3><b>James Dewar Partner</b></h3><p><span>James Dewar didn’t reveal his partner in 2022. Like many of his co-contestants, the baker chose to keep his dating life a mystery.</span></p><p><span>However, if you ask us, a man who can cook like him must obviously have someone he cooks every day for.</span></p><p><span>If there’s any news on his partner in the future, we’ll be sure to update you here.</span></p><p><span>And for those who are wondering, yes! James is gay.</span></p><h3><b>How Old Is James Dewar?</b></h3><p><span>James Dewar was 25 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>The Great British Bake Off</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>He was the season youngest contestant that season.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The youngest was Maisam (18), while the oldest was Dawn (60).</span></p><h3><b>James Dewar Job</b></h3><p><span>James Dewar is a nuclear scientist specializing in experimental, non-active simulations.

And for his contributions, he even won the NSAN Graduate of the Year award in 2022.</span></p><p><span>When James isn’t on his job, he loved to play board games, watch horror films from the 70s and 80s, and listen to music.</span></p><p><b>Trivia:</b><span> James volunteered as a shop assistant at </span><i><span>Oxfam</span></i><span> in 2015 for 5 months and as a fundraiser for </span><i><span>Amnesty International</span></i><span> from Sep 2014 to Jun 2015.</span></p><h3><b>Is James Dewar On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, as of September 2022, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>the_big_gay_baker</span></a><span> with 1.6K followers.</span></p><h3><b>James Dewar Height</b></h3><p><span>James Dewar stands tall at a height above 5 feet 11 inches (180 cm).</span></p><p><span>His district features include — dark hair, brown eyes, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>James Dewar Family</b></h3><p><span>James Dewar has come a long way and he has his family to thank for it.</span></p><p><span>He recalled that it was his mother who taught him the basics of baking and kept him motivated.</span></p><p><span>Also, James mentioned his sister Claire Ell was a very supportive sibling.
