A perfect example of that is the fact that <a href=#>Michael J. Fox adopted a fake middle initial</a> for a truly amazing reason.</p><p>Even though it is pretty well known that some stars don't go by their real names, a lot of people don't know that some major stars used to have pseudonyms they abandoned. As it turns out, Bryce Dallas Howard once used a fake name professionally early in her career.</p><p>Once fans learn what Bryce's reason for going by a fake name was, they almost certainly will be able to understand their reasoning. Amazingly enough, however, the most interesting part of the story isn't the reason why Bryce went by a fake name or what she went by.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-bryce-dallas-howard-adopt-a-fake-name-and-then-start-going-by-her-real-name>Why Did Bryce Dallas Howard Adopt A Fake Name And Then Start Going By Her Real Name</h2><p>In the past, it has been revealed that the names that Ron Howard gave to <a href=#>his children</a> have a lot of meaning. After all, Ron has given each of his children middle names that are based on where they were conceived which is why his twins actually share the same middle name, Carlyle.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Ron Howard Really Feels About His Time On 'The Andy Griffith Show'</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that Bryce's name had a lot of significance, it must have been weird for her to adopt a pseudonym during the early stages of her career. However, at least she kept her significant middle name as she went by Bryce Dallas when her career began.</p><p>In 2015 when the movie Jurassic World was set to be released, Bryce was interviewed by ABC News. During the resulting conversation, Bryce spoke about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">why she decided to lose her last name</a> when she was starting out in Hollywood.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bryce-dallas-howard-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As some people may have assumed, Bryce was worried that people would assume that she only got her career because of her last name. As a result, it made sense for her to leave the name she thought would be an albatross behind.</p><p>"When I started working, I just had my name be Bryce Dallas. I was a little insecure, hoping people don't think that I'm only doing this because of whatever."</p><p>During a separate 2011 interview with The Daily Mail, Bryce spoke about not using her last name early on and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed that bothered her parents</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bryce-dallas-howard-and-ron-howard-on-the-red-carpet-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I had dropped it because of insecurity. I didn’t want people to say I’d got a role because of my dad, but then later my parents asked me, “Aren’t you proud to come from our family? Is there something that we’ve done?” And I was like, “Omigosh, no, I am so proud of you guys!”</p><p>Going back to that interview with ABC News, Bryce said that on top of her parents' reaction to her stage name, she had another reason to start going by the title she was given at birth. According to Bryce, it occurred to her that the name Bryce Dallas sounded like something an adult star would go by.</p><h2 id=how-bryce-dallas-howard-has-followed-in-her-famous-father-ron-howard-39-s-footsteps>How Bryce Dallas Howard Has Followed In Her Famous Father Ron Howard's Footsteps</h2><p>Back in the year 1960, Ron Howard rose to fame for the first time when he became the star of a legendary sitcom. From 1960 until 1968, Ron starred in 248 episodes of the series The Andy Griffith Show which was a huge hit with audiences.</p><p>For most actors, starring in one show that was so impactful that it is fondly remembered decades later would be more than enough. However, Ron then went on to star as Richie Cunningham in 170 episodes of Happy Days.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Happy Days': Are Ron Howard And Henry Winkler Still Friends?</a></span></p><p>On top of starring in two of the most successful shows of all time, Ron has also landed to manage several other notable acting roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ron-howard-and-jason-bateman-making-arrested-development.jpg><p>On the television side of things, Ron played a major role in the show Arrested Development. Ron's movie acting credits include roles in films like American Graffiti and Grand Theft Auto among several others.</p><p>Decades after Ron's acting career began, his daughter Bryce Dallas Howard launched her own extremely successful career as a thespian.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Probably Bryce's most talked-about role was the starring part she played in the Jurassic World trilogy. On top of that, Bryce also starred in another notable film franchise since she played Victoria in several different Twilight movies.</p><p>The other highly memorable movies that Bryce has starred in include The Village, Spider-Man 3, The Help, and Terminator Salvation. On the other hand, Bryce has given incredible performances in several lesser seen movies like Manderlay and 50/50.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bryce Dallas Howard May Love Directing, But She'll Never Stop Acting</a></span></p><p>After all the success that Ron enjoyed as an actor, he went on to become one of the most successful film directors of all time. After helming his first movie in 1977, Ron has gone on to direct a slew of other films including several that were highly acclaimed and won several awards.</p><p>Most notably, Ron was the person behind movies like Apollo 13, Parenthood, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, and The Paper. On top of his award-winning films, Ron has also been the creative vision behind several blockbuster movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two examples of Ron's movies that made loads of money are The Da Vinci Code and its sequel Angels & Demons. Ron also directed Solo: A Star Wars Story, Jim Carrey's version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and Ransom.</p><p>Just like her father before her, Ron's daughter Bryce has become a successful director.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, Bryce has helmed three episodes of The Mandalorian, "Chapter 4", "Chapter 11", and "Chapter 22". Bryce also notably directed the episode of The Book of Boba Fett that many people thought was the best, "Chapter 5: Return of the Mandalorian".</p><p>As impressive as it is that Bryce has played an important role in bringing Disney+'s live-action Star Wars series to life, it is really cool that she is also set to jump to the big screen. In 2021, it was announced that Bryce has been working to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bring a reboot of the 80s family film Flight of the Navigator to Disney+</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbalecGrsJydXZmurbjArGShp6eWv6V5wqGYp5%2BVYrWmvoyrnJqkXaOurrGMq6anZZSWwqi0056paA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./yevgeny-prigozhin-death-news-is-he-still-alive-or-dead-russian-wagner-group-boss.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Yevgeny Prigozhin Death News: Is He Still Alive or Dead?
