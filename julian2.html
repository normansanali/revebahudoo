He is also passionate about music, especially the classical, indie, and jazz genres and he is also an amazing swimmer and good at other sports activities.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-27356 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julian2-youtube.jpg alt=julian2 width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-27356 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Julian2 in a YouTube video. Source: Youtube</p><h4><span>More about his Youtube</span></h4><p class=p2>His first YouTube video was “Animals Jam -Julian’s Back”. Moreover, he sometimes did live streaming on YouTube. Some of his famous videos are “<i>20 Mindblowing Animal Jam Glitches”, </i>“Top 10 Masterpieces That Shouldn’t Be Approved“, <i>“Tripping the Iceberg After 12 Years | Club Penguin</i>“, “<i>Trading from a Necklace to a Rare Spike in One Day!</i>” and “The funniest Animal Jam Suspension“.</p><p class=p2>Moreover, he posts the gameplay walkthrough and tutorial video. Julian is a social media personality earning millions of followers from all over the world. He is active on Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. Furthermore, Julian and fellow YouTuber WisteriaMoon are both notable for their Animal Jam tutorials. Julian’s main animal in the game is a beautiful white horse. He has fascinating brown stripes and his name is Infinity Silverstone.</p><p>However, he has written on his Instagram bio that he no longer makes videos and uses Instagram as a platform to connect with his fans and also share updates about his life events.</p><h2 class=p1><span id=Julian2_-Net_Worth_2024><b>Julian2 -Net Worth 2024</b></span></h2><p class=p2>He hasn’t won any of the awards or got nominated yet. Other than that his YouTube channel is still growing rapidly and has thousands of followers on other social media accounts. So, he could win awards in the future.</p><p class=p2>Likewise, he has a <strong>net worth</strong> of $40 million as of 2022. Other than that there is no information regarding Julian2’s salary and house. His famous YouTube channels, Instagram, social media personality, and other advertisements influence his net worth.</p><h2 class=p1><span id=Julian2_8211_Personal_Life><b>Julian2 – Personal Life</b></span></h2><p>He is straight and <strong>single</strong>. Moreover, he is private about his personal life and doesn’t speak much about personal information in public. However, there is no information regarding his relationship and affairs. He often shares pictures with his girlfriends on his Instagram handle. However, he has not mentioned anyone as his girlfriend. He is a great swimmer and has a passion for music. His most preferred genres are Jazz, classical, and indie.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p class=p2>Julian has been involved once in controversies throughout his career. He was suspended for two weeks for posting inappropriate content videos on his channel. He posts the content as two topiaries are mating. Moreover, they kicked him out of the group chat and also removed him from the channel banner. Despite this hardship, he never gave up and did not stop making the video.</p><p>More precisely, Julian2 made a video about AJ WikiHow tutorials and tested them jokingly. One of his tutorials was very inappropriate, however, Julian tested it out anyway. Because of his behavior, Julian’s account received a two-week suspension. Although he apologized for his actions numerous times, AJHQ didn’t want him as a part of the community anymore for his mistake.</p><p>AJHQ removed Julian from a YouTuber group chat and even took him off of the Animal Jam YouTube channel banner. The banner features other famous Jammers/Jambassadors like Aparri, WisteriaMoon, and others. As a result, Julian was unsure if he wanted to continue making gameplay videos or not since they didn’t want anything to do with him.</p><p>The Community Manager from AJHQ, Kate, made a statement and said that Julian was not permanently banned but rather was suspended. Hence, Julian would soon make videos about Animal Jam after his suspension was lifted. Julian himself shared this news with the fans that he would be staying in the community after all. Moreover, although Julian was technically still permitted to be involved in the community, there were still a bunch of people who were upset.</p><h4><span>Aparri vs. Julian2</span></h4><p>Another controversy is Aparri vs. Julian2. Julian posted a picture with an amazingly long caption on his Instagram but has since deleted the post. But the main points in that post were about how Aparri had been copying both him and WisteriaMoon in the content that Aparri puts out. He also stated that Aparri constantly uses clickbait in his videos and rips off Wisteria’s thumbnails.</p><h2 class=p1><span id=Body_Measurements><b>Body Measurements&nbsp;</b></span></h2><p class=p2>Julian has hazel eyes with light brown hair color. Moreover, Julian’s weight is around 60kg/ 132 lbs. However, there is no information on Julian’s exact height. There is no information regarding his waist, chest, or hip measurement, and has an athletic body type.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-27354 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/julian2-fam.jpg alt="julian2 " width=650 height=399 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-27354 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Julian and his parents attending his college orientation program as shared on his Instagram on 11 October 2018.
