Juliet Rylance, an English actress, and producer, has appeared in The Knick, McMafia, and Perry Mason. Her first noteworthy performance after leaving RADA was as Medea in Neil LaBute’s Bash: Latter-Day Plays at the Union Theatre in London.</strong></p><p>Later, at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre, Juliet played in The Winter’s Tale as Perdita, Troilus, and Cressida as Cressida. Rylance plays British novelist Mary Sidney in the play I Am Shakespeare that her stepfather Mark Rylance wrote. Later, in the Theater of Memory performances of Romeo and Juliet and Bash: Latter-Day Plays, the artist took on the roles of Juliet and Medea, respectively.</p><h2>Rylance, Juliet Natasha Van Kampen is the sister.</h2><p>The Juliet Rylance sister Natasha Van Kampen was a director, production designer, and writer. But on July 1, 2012, the British director passed away at the young age of 28 due to what is believed to be a cerebral bleed while traveling from New York. When she passed away, many prayers and condolences flooded social media.</p><p>The talented director got her start in the business at Sky Television when she was 16 years old. She went on to make the 2009 short film Nocturne, which dealt with insomnia, after enrolling at the London Film School. The film was then shown at the London Young Filmmakers Festival.</p><p>The sister of Juliet Rylance had worked as a production designer for music videos and television commercials and sought to get into the feature picture business. The IMDb website also has a profile for Natasha. For her roles in Rollin’ with the Nines (2006), Outlanders (2007), and Nocturene (2009), Kampen was well-known.</p><p>The sister of Juliet Rylance had a promising future in the entertainment industry and plenty of unfinished business with which to inspire the world, but regrettably, fate was not on her side. On July 27, 2012, during the London Olympics’ opening ceremony, Mark Rylance refrained from reading a passage from The Tempest because of her death.</p><h2>Parents of Natasha Van Kampen and her ethnicity</h2><p>Chris Van Kampen and Claire Van Kampen welcomed Naataasha into the world on February 25, 1984, in London. Chris Van Kampen is a professional architect, and Claire is an English playwright, composer, and director.</p><p>Mark Rylance’s mother composed the music for his 1989 production of Hamlet, and they both received the Sam Wanamaker Prize in 2007. She has written music that has been included in plays including Days and Nights and Boeing-Boeing.</p><p>In 2015, Miss Kampen worked as the Tudor-era music arranger and historical music advisor for the BBC television program Wolf Hall. Juliet Rylance and Natasha Rylance were Chris and Claire’s two kids. Due to Nataasha’s parents’ marital issues, Claire and Mark Rylance first met in 1987. They subsequently were married on December 21, 1989, in Oxfordshire.</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren’t many specifics on Kampen’s religion and ethnicity online. Mark Rylance, who is Van’s stepfather, is a seasoned British playwright, director, and actor.</p><p>For his performances on stage and in the movies, Mark has received countless honors, including an Academy Award, three BAFTA Awards, two Olivier Awards, and three Tony Awards. In addition, Rylance was named one of the 100 most influential persons in the world by Time magazine in 2016 and received a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II in 2017.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jill Diamond Net Worth: Earnings, Salary And Family</a></h3>Public interest in Jill Diamond's net worth has increased as a result of the executive director's family's recent sizeable gift to a charity.
