It was also a shift in tone. S Club was this equality of boys and girls, very positive, very uplifting, didn’t have the edge of the Spice Girls. I didn’t want to repeat it.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller</strong></p><p>“Fame is a modern phenomenon caused by the explosion of media, where there’s a zillion digital channels and snappers everywhere. It’s so attainable so that people can have their Warhol 15 minutes of fame, and some are so aggressive.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“My business is creating fame and celebrity, and I’m one of the best in the world. I know it to the finest detail. I reflect what’s out there, and if there’s a demand for something, recognize it. Don’t think I’m crass. I stand by everything I do.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller</strong></p><p>“I want it to be known for embracing so many fundamental elements of entertainment: live, competitive, interactive, that ‘sporting’ notion, the reality of getting to know real regular people who have dreams, the soap opera of the judges and contestants, the celebration of music.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“I knew I had something special with the Spice Girls because at that time there was a definite feeling of female empowerment, and I felt they could be something important, and so I was already thinking they could be huge all over the world.”&nbsp;<strong>– Simon Fuller&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“In India, you have mastered music and dance, you produce more musicals than any country in the world and that is the skills I want in Now United.
