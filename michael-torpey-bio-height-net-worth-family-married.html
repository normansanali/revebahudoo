Although the showrunner Derek Haas told Parade that there are “93 [FBI] offices in embassies and military bases around the world” ahead of the series premiere, the team primarily works out of the United States Embassy in Budapest. The 2nd season of the CBS show is almost close to the midseason fall finale, and we recently saw the appearance of Ken Dandridge, played by Michael Torpey, who had not appeared on the series since the last episode of Season 1.</p><p>In this article below, let’s learn more about the role that Michael plays in FBI: International plus his acting career, net worth, personal life, and more.</p><h3><strong>Michael Torpey On FBI: International</strong></h3><p>In the CBS show, the team of FBI Special Agents meets Michael’s character, Ken Dandrige, at the United States Embassy in Budapest.

In the finale of FBI: International Season 1, Ken was on the top of the team while they were investigating the death of an American model in Milan.
