She is an American country pop artist who earned a lot of fame back in 2014 when she owned the Crystal Bowersox. She was then regarded as "the voice you must hear" by the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.</p><p>Gabby, who competed during the 16th season, was the judges' and fans' favorite to claim the title of American Idol but somehow ended as 3rd finalist. However, that didn't stop Gabby from achieving her dream.</p><h2 id=born-to-be-a-singer>Born To Be a Singer</h2><p>After American Idol, the young trendsetter has done it all: from being one of the most successful young artists in country music history to landing No.1 single in Billboard. Let's find out what's going on with Gabby Barrett and her journey to stardom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Lesser-Known Facts About Country Music Star, Mickey Guyton</a></span></p><p>It seems like the country singer got massive success in a short span of time, but it's like the saying goes: people only see the success; they don't see the persistence. Gabby started her singing journey at the young age of nine, and she was already performing in shows when she was 11. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The star&nbsp;has always been very sweet</a>.</p><p>When she was 15, she even won the Kean Quest Talent Search in 2014. Before American Idol, she had performed at 136 shows in the year 2017 alone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rise-to-stardom>Rise to Stardom</h2><p>After gaining international popularity from American Idol, she released her debut single I Hope the following year. The song hit the number one spot in US Country Airplay Chart and remained number one of 24 weeks in the US Hot Country Songs Chart. The remix version of Gabby's debut single I Hope featuring Charlie Puth, released in 2020, became one of the biggest crossovers of last year.</p><p>The song hit number three spot in US Billboard Hot 100, making her the first female country artist to get that achievement since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Is Country Singer Granger Smith Worth?</a></span></p><p>In June 2020, Barrett released her debut album Goldmine, adding to over 50 million-plus career-on-demand streams. Her debut album "garnered 15.98 million on-demand streams in its opening week, breaking the record for the largest streaming week ever for a debut country album by a woman," according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OffBeat Magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=personal-life>Personal Life</h2><p>As for Gabby's relationship status, she is married to rock singer Cade Foehner. They got to know each other on the sets of American Idol and started dating each other. Then the couple tied the knot in October 2019 and welcomed their first baby girl Baylah May Foehner on January 18.</p><p>The new mom wrote on her Instagram, "Gotten to spend a very sweet week with our newest addition...meet our girl." Her hubby commented on this lovely post, writing, "What an honor to be your husband. Thank you for bearing me a child, my Wife!"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The musicians met and fell in love during their respective runs in season 16 of American Idol back in 2018. Gabby and Cade revealed they were expanding their sweet family back in August. At the time, Cade shared on Instagram, "I have the most amazing Wife in the world. I can't possibly come up with strong enough words to honor her as she has honored me in giving me a baby girl!"</p><p>Gabby debuted her baby bump at the ACM Awards and has been documenting her journey to motherhood ever since. She even shared a video clip of Cade practicing changing a diaper on a stuffed animal. There no doubt that Gabby and Cade are going to be awesome parents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gabby-barrett-wins-big-at-billboard-music-awards>Gabby Barrett Wins Big at Billboard Music Awards</h2><p>Gabby is currently signed with Warner Music Nashville, and her net worth is estimated to be around 300,000 dollars. She has around 2 million followers across social media.</p><p>The talented star is now is a Billboard Music Award Winner, times two. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The country singer happily accepted her first award of the night for Top County Female Artist</a>. She also won the award for Top Country Song for her masterpiece I Hope. Additionally, Gabby took home fan-voted Top Collaboration for her song&nbsp;I Hope featuring Charlie Puth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the ceremony, Gabby even gave a shout-out to her newborn daughter, Baylah May.</p><p>This is the first BBMA win for Gabby, who acknowledged the fact that she's new to this. One more time, she thanked her husband, who knew how to perfectly fluff the train of her gorgeous gold dress as she accepted her awards.</p><p>The singer was nominated for nine BBMAs, and just before the awards, she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Access Hollywood</a> that she was hoping to take home a win, saying, "I've never been to the Billboard Music Awards before... I've never been to an award show where it's like all genre, I've been to, you know, country stuff." Then she added, "So it will be cool to see some faces of people that I grew up listening to... And then, of course, with the nominations, I am hoping to take a win home maybe."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As of now, she has her next tour scheduled from June 2021 onwards and performed at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards.
