This date is <a href=# rel=noopener>evident in an Instagram post</a> that Max did on August 11, 2018. In the post, he captioned that Lexi celebrated her 30th birthday the day before. Counting back, it means she was born in 1988 and not 1989.</p><p>Lexi was born and brought up in Santa Rosa, California, United States. She also attended her formative and high schools there.</p><p>For her high education, she attended Ursuline High School. The high school was a private Catholic all-girl school in Santa Rosa, California. The Ursuline Sisters of the Roman Union owned the high school.</p><p>Many years after she graduated, the institution<a href=# rel=noopener> was closed in 2011</a>.</p><p>Following her graduation, she attended Loyola Marymount University. There, she obtained a bachelor’s Degree in Business Management and Human Resources in 2010.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lexi_Murphys_Career_as_a_Marketer_and_Other_Pursuits></span><strong>Lexi Murphy’s Career as a Marketer and Other Pursuits</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Max Thieriot’s wife is currently a customer relations officer at Senses Wines. The company was founded by her husband and Christopher Strieter among others.</p><p>Lexi took this career path in 2012, a year before she was married to Max.</p><p>Prior to that, she worked with different organizations. She was an Association Manager, Heritage Wine Society at Landmark Vineyards from 2010 to 2012.</p><p>The Santa Rosa born was also a Sales Person at Busalacchi Farms and an intern at Caymus Vineyards as well as Kayne Anderson Rudnick.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Truth_about_Lexi_Murphys_Love_Life_with_Max></span><strong>The Truth about Lexi Murphy’s Love Life with Max</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Max and Lexi met in Santa Rosa, California, and started dating in 2005. At the time, both of them were rounding up their high school education.</p><p>It is worthy of note that they did not attend the same school as some sources suggest. Rather, Max briefly attended middle school in Santa Rosa but graduated in Forestville, California, in a school known as El Molino High School.</p><p>The couple dated for 7 years before the Catch That Kid actor <a href=# rel=noopener>asked Lexi to marry him</a> while they were on a two-week vacation in 2012.</p><p>Thieriot married his wife on June 1, 2013. The ceremony was held in Arizona and it was attended by friends, family, and his Catch That Kid co-star Kristen Stewart.</p><p>For all we know, Lexi maintains a little distance from the public space throughout her being the wife of a famous <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood star.</a> Yet, she has in one way or another helped in her husband’s career.</p><p>One such way was when Murphy <a href=# rel=noopener>helped him realize</a> that she had to feature in the TV show Fire Country – a CBS show that Max also co-wrote.</p><p><strong>See Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Darragh Moore- Every Interesting Thing You Didn’t Know About Lecrae’s Wife</a></strong></p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=She_is_a_Mother_of_Two></span><strong>She is a Mother of Two</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lexi and her actor husband are parents of two boys – Beaux Thieriot and Maximus Thieriot.</p><p>Their first son Beaux was born in 2015, two years after the couple were married. The second child, Maximus was born in 2018.</p><p>Most details about the children remain under wraps but according to the <a href=# rel=noopener>Senses Wines official website</a>, Beaux has been listed as a chief toddler in the company while Max is a VP baby.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kuabEyGakrqqgncZutdJmpJqwXam1qrHRoqatq12stqexjJyjqKuVp3qtu86kZJqsXZ2ys3nLop2eZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dean-lindsay-get-divorced-relationship-and-family-tree-658031-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dean | Lindsay Get Divorced?
