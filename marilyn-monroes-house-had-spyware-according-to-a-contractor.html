Although her death was ruled a "probable overdose, or suicide," in the official autopsy report, several doubted this in 1962, and more have come to question it throughout the years as different people have come forward claiming to have knowledge of what truly happened to the Gentlemen Prefer Blondes actress.</p><p>Monroe's death was initially believed to be suicide, or an accidental overdose. This was also concluded based how Monroe had been found in her bedroom, and the multiple prescription bottles the Niagara actress had on her bedside table. One recently-filled sleep medication, was empty.</p><p>There was no drinking glass, champagne bottles or anything else seen she could have used to swallow the pills, which some believe support the theory Monroe was murdered.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Madonna Fans Horrified As She Stages Marilyn Monroe's Final Moments</a></span></p><p>It seems from the start rumors surrounded the night of Monroe's death, and some believed she'd been murdered.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eventually the star's house was sold, and the couple who bought it eventually decided to do some remodeling.

They hired a contractor to replace the roof and remodel the house and the contractor discovered a sophisticated eavesdropping and telephone tapping system that covered every room in the house."</p><p>"The components were not commercially available in 1962, but were - in the words of a retired Justice Department official - 'standard FBI issue'. The new owners spent $100,000 to remove the bugging devices from the house."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe Did The Unthinkable Going After FOX's Studios, And The Outcome Stunned Those In Hollywood</a></span></p><p>It has been rumored that the Some Like It Hot actress had an affair with former President John F.
