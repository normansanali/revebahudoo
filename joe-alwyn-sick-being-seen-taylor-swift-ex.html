Apparently, he's a lot more angry than he let on about the situation. The insider said that Joe is reportedly upset with the press painting him as just "Taylor's ex", and with Taylor herself for turning swifties against him.</p><h2 id=joe-alwyn-wants-people-to-stop-seeing-him-as-quot-taylor-39-s-ex-quot>Joe Alwyn Wants People To Stop Seeing Him As "Taylor's Ex"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_taylor-swift-fans-are-convinced-they-know-the-real-reason-why-the-singer-and-joe-alwyn-broke-up_bk_a1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have remained mostly quiet about the true reasons behind their breakup (unless you count Taylor writing songs about it). Neither of them had directly referred to it until Joe Alwyn broke his silence a few days ago, shocking swifties by being so open about his feelings.</p><p>Many theories have been going around about their split, including one that cited Joe's alleged infidelity as the cause. <a href=#>The actor seemed to clear that up in an interview recently</a>, but people still wonder what went on between them.</p><p>The speculation is reportedly wearing on the actor, and <strong>he's tired of their breakup overshadowing his career</strong>, as he wants to be known for more than just being Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend. Apparently, that was the reason he chose to finally address their breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Joe wanted to get this over with once and for all so he can move forward with his life and his career,' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">a source told DailyMail.com</a>. "He never wanted to say anything and was hoping it would all blow over, but it hasn't."</p><p>The source also claimed that he's upset with the singer for monetizing the end of their relationship. "<strong>Taylor has made a fortune off their breakup </strong>by forming an entire album around it. Meanwhile, <strong>he has been cast as 'Taylor's ex.'</strong>"</p><p>Joe Alwyn is seemingly requesting the press to stop bringing up his relationship with Taylor.</p><p>"Joe has moved on and is doing promotional work for his films and upcoming projects, so he decided he needed to get this out to move forward. He wants to be asked about his films, not about Taylor."</p><h2 id=the-source-compared-joe-alwyn-to-travis-kelce>The Source Compared Joe Alwyn To Travis Kelce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-at-coachella.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a very bold statement, the insider decided to compare Taylor Swift's relationship with Joe to her current romance with Travis Kelce. The source compared the way they react to the spotlight that follows the pop star wherever she goes, implying that the Kansas City Chiefs tight end is milking the relationship for attention.</p><p>"<strong>Their romance was private â€“ quite the opposite of her relationship with Travis [Kelce]</strong>. It was partly due to covid restrictions, but they also preferred it that way," the source claimed.</p><p>Apparently, Joe Alwyn finds the attention he's getting due to the breakup almost unbearable.</p><p>"He cannot go anywhere without being asked about Taylor. He had his people tell everyone in advance that he was not going to answer questions about Taylor, but he knew that is all people wanted to ask him about. <strong>It became depressing and emotionally draining</strong>."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-joe-alwyn.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Source Shares How Travis Kelce Truly Feels About Taylor Swift Writing Songs About Joe Alwyn">Source Shares How Travis Kelce Truly Feels About Taylor Swift Writing Songs About Joe Alwyn</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce reportedly doesn't care if Taylor Swift wants to write about her exes.</p><p>Lastly, in what seemed like a dig at the singer, the source stated that Joe was hurt by the songs in The Tortured Poets Department.</p><p>"He wishes her no ill will, but <strong>he also needed her to know that appearing to address their relationship without confirming who she is singing about can have a lasting and hurtful effect</strong> on the people/ men involved," they said, complaining about the way fans act and claiming that "Swifties never let anything die."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mqqKbm2KvprXNoGSsnZWjerWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIyer2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./kenny-johnson-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kenny Johnson Net Worth 2024">&larr;
