He is a TV screenwriter, film and TV producer, and creator of more than 100 shows.&nbsp;Lear is known for many popular sitcoms from the 1970s, like All in the Family, Maude, Sanford and Son, One Day at a Time, The Jeffersons, and Good Times, which won multiple awards.</p><p>Lear has kept making TV shows, like the remake of “One Day at a Time” in 2017 and the return of “Good Times” on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Netflix</a> in 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Norman Lear: Net Worth 2023</strong></h2><p><strong>The American writer and producer of the TV show <a href=# rel=noopener>Norman Lear</a> have a <a href=# rel=nofollow>net worth</a> of $200 million as of 2023.</strong> Some of the most popular TV shows of the 1970s, like “All in the Family,” “Sanford and Son,” “One Day at a Time,” and “Good Times,” was made by Norman Lear.</p><p>He is also a well-known political activist who has given a lot of money to progressive causes and politicians. Lear started the group People for the American Way in 1980 to fight against what he saw as the conservative Christian agenda.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Norman Lear: Early Life Details</strong></h2><p>In 1922, Norman Lear was born into a Jewish family in the city of New Haven, Connecticut. His mother was Jeanette, and his father, Hyman, was a salesman who went from place to place. He had one sister named Claire who was younger than him. When Lear was nine, his father went to jail for selling fake bonds, and while he was tinkering with his radio, he met an anti-Semitic Catholic radio priest, Father Charles Coughlin.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-48.png><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Norman Lear: Personal Life Details</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bill Clinton</a>, who was president at the time, gave him the National Medal of Arts in 1999. In 2001, he paid $8.1 million for one of the first copies of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Norman Lear is a political activist who started the group People for the American Way in 1981. He supports the rights in the First Amendment. In 2004, he started the nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign Declare Yourself.</p><p>In 2009, he started BornAgainAmerican.org. People say that Lear made it possible for many African Americans to work in television. At the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors, Lear was given an award.</p><p>He’s been married three times and has six kids from those marriages. His first marriage was from 1944 to 1956 and was to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Charlotte Rosen</a>. Between 1956 and 1986, he was married to Frances Loeb. Since 1987, he has been married to Lyn Davis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Norman Lear: Career Details</strong></h2><p>In the 1990s, Lear went back to making sitcoms for TV. He made “Sunday Dinner,” “The Powers That Be,” and “704 Hauser,” but none of them were very popular. In 1997, Lear and Jim George made “Channel Umptee-3,” a Saturday morning animated show for kids. Even though it got good reviews, it was canceled after one season because it didn’t get enough viewers.</p><p>In his later years, Lear still worked in the media. In 2017, he helped make a new version of his show “One Day at a Time” for Netflix. He also started a podcast called “All of the Above with Norman Lear” that same year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What Happened To Norman Lear?</strong></h2><p>Norman found lasting love with his wife, Lyn Lear, outside of his busy Hollywood career. In 1987, they got married. They had Benjamin, Brianna, and Madelaine all at the same time. The author is also the father of Ellen, whom he had with his first wife Charlotte Rosen, and of Kate and Maggie, whom he had with his second wife Frances Loeb.</p><p>In July 2022, the father of five turned 100 years old. He had been waiting for the big event for a long time.</p><p>In October 2019, the star told Closer Weekly, “I’m concentrating on 97 and getting closer to 100.” “I want to see your smile when you’re a hundred years old and talking to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/image-49.png><p>In the spotlight, Norman also shared some of the best advice he had learned over the years, as well as his positive view on getting older.</p><p>“I’ve learned that we don’t pay enough attention to two small words. He said at the time, “Those are ‘over’ and ‘next.'” “When something is done, it’s done, and we move on. If there was a hammock between these two words, that would be the best way I know to explain what it means to live in the moment. So, I’m glad we’re spending this time together, and I’m looking forward to the next.”</p><h2><strong>Divorce Settlement</strong></h2><p>After 28 years of marriage, Norman and his second wife, Frances, filed for divorce in 1985. Norman was told to pay Francis a divorce settlement of $112 million, which is about $270 million today. This was a large sum at the time. Frances then used $30 million (around $70 million with inflation) from her settlement to start a magazine for women over 45 called Lear’s. Within six years, the magazine was gone.</p><h2><strong>Norman Lear’s Real Estate</strong></h2><p style=color:#252525>In 1995, Norman and his third wife, Lyn, spent $6.5 million on a big house in Los Angeles’s Brentwood neighborhood. The 8-acre property has a main house that is 14,000 square feet, a guest house, a pool, a gym, a spa, tennis courts, security offices, and a 35-car garage. In 2015, he put the house on the market for $55 million. In November 2019, he put the house back on the market, but this time for a little less than $40 million.</p><p style=color:#252525>Norman and Lyn also own a two-bedroom condo near Central Park in New York City. They paid $10 million for it in 2008.</p><p style=color:#252525>In 2001, Lear and his wife paid $8.1 million for one of the first copies of the United States Declaration of Independence. In the years that followed, Lear took the document on a planned road trip around the country. He took it to presidential libraries, museums, the Winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Norman Lear (@thenormanlear)</a></p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Rapper Erica Banks Net Worth 2022 (Forbes) A Real-Time Update on Richer Life!</a></li><li><a href=#>How Rich Are Charles III?
