Source: Youtube</p><h2><span id=RiceGum_8211_Youtube_Controversy>RiceGum – Youtube Controversy</span></h2><p>RiceGum has been linked to several controversies. One of them is when Ian Carter, a YouTuber by the channel name of iDubbbzTV, made an episode of his popular “Content Cop” series on him.</p><p>It is a series where he critiques other YouTubers’ content and this particular video received over 47 million views and over 2 million likes. The end of this video starred the diss track Asian Jake Paul.</p><p>In response to the video, he also made the diss track Frick da Police. This diss track received a negative reception, currently holding 1.3 million dislikes as of January 2020. This makes it the 40th most disliked video on the platform.</p><p>Further, he has also been in controversies with other popular YouTubers and musicians such as James Rallison, Gabbie Hanna, and Bhad Bhabie.</p><p>More precisely, he had roasted a 10-year-old singer, Alabama Parker. She is the daughter of singer Travis Parker. He roasted her in his video stating her actions were inappropriate for her age and criticized her upbringing and lifestyle harshly.</p><p>Then her father and stepmother reacted instantly by getting this video removed from YouTube.</p><h2><span id=The_controversy_involving_Gabbi_Hanna>The controversy involving Gabbi Hanna</span></h2><p>More recently, RiceGum was involved with another video blogger, Gabbi Hanna. Gabbi posted a video claiming that he had physically assaulted her and destroyed her cell phone. She also posted a video of the wounds that he inflicted on Snapchat.</p><p>Strangely this led to an increase in the number of her subscribers and a decrease in the number of his followers.</p><p>Later, he accepted that he trashed the cell phone but the wounds were stretch marks. The viewers have voiced that he could have dealt with the issue more politely and that he was too caustic.</p><p>Although she has not filed a legal suit but has asked for the compensation of her cellphone. Further, Twitch banned him as he showed a BB Gun in one of his videos.</p><h2><span id=Hong_Kong_vlog_controversy>Hong Kong vlog controversy</span></h2><p>On 12 June 2018, RiceGum uploaded a video of himself in Hong Kong through his main YouTube channel. In the video, he asks strangers and a staff member in a local McDonald’s if they have dogs on the menu as he says Asians eat cats and dogs in China.</p><p>He also jokes about wanting to have dog and cat meat to eat as he is “always open to trying new things”. He comments on Hong Kong street food beef entrails, questioning if it is dog meat and saying “shit looks disgusting”.</p><p>He filmed comedian M2THAK walking up to a man in the Hong Kong International Airport, yelling</p><p>“Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?”,</p><p>reportedly imitating a scene from the Hollywood movie Rush Hour starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker to imply that Asian communities do not understand English.</p><p>He also filmed M2THAK repositioning mannequins in a store window into sexually suggestive poses. The video included a scene where they gave half-eaten ice cream to a local Hong Kong man.</p><p>Online commentary has compared the video to <a href=#>Logan Paul</a>‘s Japan vlog controversy and pointed out that he is being disrespectful and culturally insensitive in a foreign country.</p><h4>Reactions and Defence</h4><p>Jimmy Wong also tweeted saying that he is disappointed as his videos are now “disrespectful, ignorant, borderline racist, & shameful to all creators, especially Asians” and asked him to “please grow up & stop”.</p><p>Two weeks later, on 26 June, when the video received different criticism in China and other Asian countries, he released a video, saying that he was just “joking around”.</p><p>He defended himself saying that he was just trying to use Asian stereotypes to point to American comedy culture and that people are being too sensitive. He further explained that he believed it was acceptable as he was Asian.</p><p>He also said that he wanted to return to Hong Kong, but said that he was “kind of scared now because the people may hit me and beat me up”.</p><p>However, many called this video insincere.&nbsp;Media site Polygon described that his apology seemed “somewhat glib manner” and What’s Trending said the “apology” “sounded incredibly forced”.</p><p>YouTube has removed the video of his Hong Kong tour due to the violation of the Terms of Service.</p><h2><span id=Mystery_box_website_promotion>Mystery box website promotion</span></h2><p>In January 2019, RiceGum and Jake Paul came under fire for promoting MysteryBrand. It is a website that offers the chance to open a digital “mystery box” of pre-selected items.</p><p>It was in an exchange with the promise to win a mystery box in real life randomly. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site and concluded the site is a scam.</p><p>In response, he made a video and said:</p><p>“No-one said anything, it wasn’t a problem back then. Why did no-one bring it up, or even talk about these guys? This mystery box thing has been on the internet for 3 or 4 months even from other creators, but as soon as I do it, it’s a problem?”.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-35575 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/RiceGum-with-Logan-Paul.jpg alt="RiceGum " width=650 height=812 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-35575 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: He attending an event with Logan Paul.
