Many know her from her hit reality <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>court show</a>,&nbsp;Judge Judy, which first premiered in Sept. 1996. The New York native graduated from New York Law School in 1965, however, she did not become a TV sensation until she was 54 years old! These days, fans can catch Judy on her new show, <span>Judy Justice</span>,&nbsp;which premiered in Nov. 2021, after Judge Judy&nbsp;ended that July. Amid her continued success, below is a closer look at Judy’s three marriages, two of them being to her longtime love, <strong>Jerry Sheindlin</strong>, 89.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Judge-Judy-Jerry-Sheindlin-SS-embed-1.jpg><h2>Judy Sheindlin’s Husband, Jerry Sheindlin</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The family court judge has been married to her current husband, Jerry, for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>over 40 years</a>, as they first got married in 1977. Although neither of them have social media accounts, Judy has spoken about her hubby during a few interview over her career. Notably, her time on&nbsp;Judge Judy&nbsp;took place nearly two decades after she and Jerry got married for the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first time</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>In a 2020 interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>, Judy revealed what she got Jerry for his <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>85th birthday</a>. “I didn’t know what to get him for his 85th birthday,” she told&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ellen DeGeneres</a>&nbsp;</strong>at the time. “And I figured, what greater gift could there be for somebody at 85 than a motorcycle?” Jerry, who was notably in the audience, confirmed that his wife gifted him a Harley Davidson tricycle. The gift, as Judy explained, was worth a whopping $40K, which she hilariously called the price “not bad.”</p><h2>Their Divorce</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Judge-Judy-Jerry-Sheindlin-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Judy and Jerry’s marriage was not always perfect though, as the couple actually divorced in 1990, soon after the death of Judy’s father, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>. Jerry explained what occurred to their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>calling it quits</a> in the 2020 book, What Makes a Marriage Last. “She said to me, ‘If you can’t maneuver this, I’m going to divorce you,'” he told authors <strong>Marlo Thomas</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Phil Donahue</strong> at the time. “And I said, ‘Oh, yeah? I dare you.’ And the next day I got divorce papers. The next day. So, that was the end of that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Jerry, a retired New York Supreme Court justice, and his wife were only divorced for one year and remarried in 1991. He also quipped about how they met in a bar during a 1999 interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Los Angeles Times</a>. “I just finished trying a murder case as a defense lawyer,” Jerry said. “She was a prosecutor. There was a reporter from the New York Post there at the bar, and I was speaking to him about the case. Judy came walking in and put her finger in my face and said, ‘And who is this?’ I said, ‘Lady, get your finger out of my face.’ We’ve been together ever since.”</p><h2>Her First Husband, Ronald Levy</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Before Jerry, Judy was married to prosecutor&nbsp;<strong>Ronald Levy&nbsp;</strong>for 12 years. The former couple got married in 1964, however, they called it quits by 1976. Judy even opened up to&nbsp;Fox News in 2017 about her first husband. “My first husband is a lovely, lovely man but he always viewed my job as a hobby and there came a time where I resented that,” she said to the outlet, via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The US Sun</a>. “I was 20, almost 21. So I became a mom … All my friends were getting married, there was still those pressures even in those years.”</p><h2>Judy’s Children</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As Judy revealed during that interview, she became a mom at 20 years old when she and Ronald welcomed their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first child</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Jamie</strong>, in 1966, and later, the ex couple welcomed a son,&nbsp;<strong>Jamie</strong>, in 1968. Once they divorced and Judy married Jerry, she officially became a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>stepmother</a> to his three kids:&nbsp;<strong>Nicole</strong>, 55,&nbsp;<strong>Jonathan</strong>, 56, and&nbsp;<strong>Gregory</strong>, 59. Nicole and Gregory both attended law school, whereas, Jonathan paved his own path and went on to become a doctor. Judy is a proud <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>grandmother</a> to 13 grandchildren.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mum6CdXZ%2FCpcWMoaysmpGjsW6Bj3BrbnFmZA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-much-is-vinicius-jr-worth-in-2023.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How much is Vinicius Jr worth in 2023?">&larr;
