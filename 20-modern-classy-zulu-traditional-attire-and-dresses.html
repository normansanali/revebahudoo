Virtually all of these cultures and traditions started existing a long time ago and are being passed down from one generation to another. In South Africa, the food people eat, the language they speak, and even the cloth they wear tell of their ethnic backgrounds and more. For instance, a typical Zulu man can be distinguished by his Zulu traditional attire; so is a Xhosa man or even someone from Pedi.</p><p>The Zulu tribe in South Africa is well-known for its population and rich colorful cultural heritage, making them unique and outstanding. All Zulu attires are used by all Zulus of different ages and gender. However, there could be a situation where you find some Zulu traditional attire meant for a particular set of people from a particular social class. But generally, everything about traditional attire in Zululand makes one easily fall in love with the tribe.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=zulu-traditional-attire-for-women></span><strong>Zulu Traditional Attire For Women</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the Zulu culture, there are different attires to mark different stages in the lives of both men and women, signifying the different milestones achieved. These attire varieties include traditional for ceremonial or culturally celebratory occasions and modern westernized clothing for everyday use.</p><p>Women from the region wear different attires depending on whether they are married, engaged, or single. For instance, the isigcebhezana is a miniskirt that women essentially wear in Zulu ceremonies. In fact, each phase of a Zulu’s life is greatly determined by a specific type of attire.&nbsp;An unmarried woman typically wears the skirt and nothing on the top, while a special type of clothing is reserved for pregnant women. ‘Isibamba,’ to be precise, is a common attire among pregnant women.</p><p>Below are some Zulu traditional attire for women.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-isidwaba-and-isicwaya></span><strong>1. Isidwaba and Isicwaya</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Isidwaba and Isicwaya are part of the attires won by a Zulu bride during her traditional marriage ceremony. A typical Zulu bride changes her outfit about three times during a marriage ceremony. The Isicwaya is an outfit made up of animal skin worn from the breast down to the trunk, and this goes in hand with the Isidwaba, which is a leather skirt and a hat that symbolizes the bride has been taken.</p><p>There is also the inkehli, which is a hat for her head as well as colorful beaded necklaces, bracelets, red and white ocher designs for her legs and arms, a beaded and twisted fig leaves-made veils, oxtail fringes for her elbows and knees, a goat’s hair fringe for her neck and lastly an Assegai, a small knife that symbolizes her virginity.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-zulu-inspired-long-gown></span><strong>2.

Its beauty starts from the shoulders down to the knees, where it branches out in a flare giving the bride room to walk comfortably. The gown is adorned with colorful beads at the neck and wrists to bring that Zulu vibe, topped with the traditional Zulu cap called the Isicholo.</p><p>Zulu mermaid gowns are gorgeous and colorful. They are every lady’s dream attire, especially on their big day.

The warrior headband is usually worn only by married men. A regular attire for a Zulu man involves the animal skin and feather, which cover various parts of his body, albeit minimally.</p><p>Interestingly, the skin used is symbolic of the social status of a typical Zulu man. For example, tribal heads or the royal family are the only ones that wear the skin of a leopard. They cover their shoulders with the amambatha and wear the ibheshu, injobo, and isinene on their lower half.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=11-african-inspired-traditional-print></span> <strong>11. </strong><strong>African-Inspired Traditional Print</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Men wear this simple but classy outfit during occasions and ceremonies where the white shirt is matched with a fabric made of prints of different colors.
