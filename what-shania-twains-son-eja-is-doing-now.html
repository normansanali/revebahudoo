A perfect example of that is when a popular celebrity has a child, the media often wants to learn everything they can about them.Unsurprisingly, some <a href=#>celebrity parents have tried to keep their kids out of the spotlight</a> even though that rarely works since the paparazzi can be so intrusive. On the other hand, some stars seem to post a new photo of their child daily, if not more.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Life Lesson Harry Styles Learned From Shania Twain</a></span>Throughout Shania Twain's career, she has managed to fall between those two categories. Rarely willing to share photos of her son, Shania has instead opted to reveal little tidbits about his life with interviewers here and there.A perfect example of the fact that Shania has revealed that similar to other <a href=#>kids that followed in their famous parents' footsteps</a>, her son wants to make a living in the same business as her. However, the way Shania's son wants to follow in her footsteps will likely shock many of her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=who-is-the-father-of-shania-twain-s-son>Who Is The Father Of Shania Twain's Son?</h2><p>Back when Shania Twain's career was going to another level, the world learned that she'd walked down the aisle. In 1993, Shania married a man named Robert Lange. While that name may not ring a bell for a lot of people, Lange arguably is one of the most famous rock music producers of all time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shania Twain's Husband's Cheating Scandal Changed Her Life In More Ways Than One</a></span></p><p>During Robert "Mutt" Lange's lengthy career, he has worked with some of the biggest recording artists of his generation.</p><p>Some notable examples of Mutt's collaborators include AC/DC, Def Leppard, Foreigner, Michael Bolton, The Cars, Bryan Adams, Huey Lewis and the News, Billy Ocean, Celine Dion, Britney Spears, Maroon 5, <a href=#>Lady Gaga</a>, and Muse.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of working with all of those performers, Mutt also famously produced and co-wrote several of Shania's most memorable songs.</p><p>When Mutt and Shania weren't busy making music together, they had a son named Eja together. Unfortunately, Shania and Mutt's marriage ended in a very scandalous way in 2010.</p><h2 id=what-is-shania-twain-s-son-doing-now>What Is Shania Twain's Son Doing Now?</h2><p>Since Shania Twain's son Eja was born on August 12, 2001, he is 21 years old as of this writing. Even though a lot of people who are that age are still struggling to figure out who they want to be, that doesn't seem to be the case for Eja. After all, Shania has revealed that her son has seemingly discovered his passion.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Shania Twain May Not Have Made Music For 15 Years, But That Doesn't Mean She's Done Singing</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that <a href=#>Shania has led such a fascinating life</a>, many media outlets have always been interested in talking to her. During several of the resulting interviews, Shania has talked about her son's plans to work in the music business. One example of that is the time that Shania described her son, Eja's "crazy passion for making music".</p><p>Given that Shania is a country music legend, her fans likely would assume that Eja would embrace that genre. Failing that, it would make sense if Eja developed a passion for rock music consdering the genre his dad is best known for.</p><p>As it turns out, however, when Shania spoke to Sounds Like Nashville, she revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eja's passion is for a genre of music that arguably is the polar opposite of country</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He's been making music for a few years now. He definitely listens to EDM, so that's where he is as a fan." When she was interviewed by Kelly Ripa and Ryan Seacrest, Shania spoke about the difference in the way she and her son work while also revealing she trades ideas with Eja.</p><p>"Every once in a while we get into the studio together and we send each other ideas.</p><p>"I work on a different system than he does so that can be a little complicated too because I'm on Pro Tools and he's on Logic, but otherwise we just send music back and forth."</p><p>"I use the guitar, he uses synthesizers. You never know, maybe someday we'll come up with something really great."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Shania's fans likely would be surprised that her son has embraced such a different genre of music, one part of Eja's plans for his career isn't overly surprising. After all, Shania has revealed that just like his father, Eja prefers to work behind the scenes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsCprc2imGasp5a2r7%2BMrKanZZWfrm610mabqKGenHqvu9Zo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-does-hawkeyes-mysterious-rolex-belong-to.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who does Hawkeyes mysterious Rolex belong to?">&larr;
