Tiffany and Brett tied the knot last spring but couldn't confirm their marriage or discuss their romance. Since the Love Is Blind season 4 reunion aired, the couple has shared more about their life.</p><p>Tiffany and Brett were the only Love Is Blind season 4 couple shown who were not involved in a messy love triangle on the show. <a href=#>Love Is Blind's Tiffany and Brett</a> matched from the start and were the first couple engaged. They then had the least amount of drama, as their main issue was Tiffany feeling overwhelmed by wedding planning. Brett and Tiffany married without any doubts, as they declared they were deeply in love and found their person in one another. The couple happily wed to the delight of the audience and their friends and family.</p><h2 id=where-do-brett-amp-tiffany-live-in-2023>Where Do Brett & Tiffany Live In 2023?</h2><p>Tiffany and Brett were considered the golden couple of Love Is Blind season 4. Brett was one of several Love Is Blind season 4 cast members who did not live in Seattle. Like Kwame Appiah, Brett lived in Portland, Washington, a more affordable city but several hours from Seattle. Both Tiffany and Kwame's wife, Chelsea Griffin, decided to move to their husband's cities in the last year. That means Tiffany and Brett now call Portland home in 2023, as they reside in a home there together.</p><h2 id=how-is-married-life-for-brett-amp-tiffany>How Is Married Life For Brett & Tiffany?</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Tiffany and Brett have a thriving and happy marriage. The couple aired no problems, scandals, or issues on Love Is Blind season 4 and have maintained their lovable image. This is a rare feat, though the likability factor of the couple has earned them enormous fan support. Brett and Tiffany are the most famous Love Is Blind season 4 couple by a long shot, as they have each seen their social media profiles explode over the last few weeks. Tiffany has 687K Instagram followers, while Brett sits at around 637K.</p><p>Brett and Tiffany regularly attend sporting events, such as Seattle Seahawks games. They've also been traveling worldwide, enjoying each other's company. While moving to Portland was an adjustment for Tiffany, they thrive in their marriage.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-next-for-brett-amp-tiffany>What's Next For Brett & Tiffany?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/love_is_blind_s4_e8_00_17_38_14r.jpg><p>Since Brett and Tiffany are not single, they will not appear on any Netflix dating spin-off shows like Perfect Match. However, Brett and Tiffany appear in Love Is Blind: After The Altar season 4. The show, which follows couples after they marry to check in on their married life, airs on Friday, September 1, at 12 a.m. PST on Netflix. Given the popularity of Brett and Tiffany and how unproblematic the duo is, it's likely that they could appear in other content for Netflix. At the very least, they will likely be invited to many Netflix reality TV events since <strong>Love Is Blind </strong>fans adore them.</p><p><strong>Love Is Blind: After The Altar </strong>airs on Netflix on Friday, September 1 at 12 a.m. PST.</p>Related Topics About The Author<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirk6eyprrRmqWtZpOkunC4zq%2BcZqGjYq%2Bttc2dZKydkai8r3mTZpmrnaSperW1xZ%2BYp7Fdqr2lrdOeZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alanah-rae-net-worth-272564.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alanah Rae Net Worth">&larr;
