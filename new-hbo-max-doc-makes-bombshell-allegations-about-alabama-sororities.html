Many blonde-haired, blue-eyed girls with bible quotes in their bios grace the page with professional photos of themselves and an introduction paragraph excitedly explaining why they wish to rush.</p><p>The new documentary exposes girls admitting to having eating disorders because of what boys said to them growing up and it takes a deep dive into the mental health inside Greek life.</p><p>Filmmaker Rachel Fleit told Vice: “I wanted to create a documentary that was grounded in this culture, this Greek system, and it would serve as this lightning rod to talk about what it means to be a young woman.</p><p>“We could talk about feminism, and we could talk about competition between women, body image, racism, sexism, classism, and sexual assault on campus or in general. There were all these big topics that I thought we could explore in the film by going into the Greek system. And we did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/T5TJN8.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Bullying and racism are still happening</strong></h2><p>Despite the fact that Greek life became desegregated in 2013, The University of Alabama has still been hit with accusations of racism.</p><p>In the HBO trailer, an unidentified woman claimed the University of Alabama has a “prominent” history of racism, saying there’s a strong “undercurrent” of it at the school.</p><p>“The culture at Alabama is f—ing weird,” one girl admitted.</p><p>Another unidentified girl said she received weird looks for the color of her skin while on campus.</p><p>“Everyone here will just look at you when you have any color in you,” she said in the trailer.</p><p>Makayla Culpepper was reportedly dropped from every sorority last year after she revealed she was mixed race. Although the true reason she was dropped was never revealed, many speculated that it was due to her race, according to DailyMail.com.</p><p>In 2021, the school’s sororities were nearly 90 percent white, according to the Crimson White, the school’s paper.</p><p>The sororities have also been plagued with bullying rumors as well, with some saying the girls are being fake nice. Ex-members said they were ‘constantly screamed at,’ treated like children, and accused the houses of being cliquey.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Sororities are pricey</strong></h2><p>According to the University, members spend more than $4,000 on fees per semester.</p><p>However, for those living in the house with an added meal fee, it could go up to around $7,500 per semester.</p><p>One girl, named Jess, claimed her sorority tried to charge her $3,200 for missing recruitment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25ma2pfo7K4ecebpmalka16pbvCZqSao5WoeqO7zJuqoZ2coXqiuMuenpqsmaS7tHnAm6aurF2WuaKuwKaYZqufp7yztdOinKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./simon-fuller.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Simon Fuller Net Worth  $650 Million">&larr;
