It can't happen again.</p><p>"I gave my son his instructions and he chose to follow a different (path)… but he can't override his dad. Because his dad is speaking sense and who will back me up? The public.</p><p>"When they understand: I lost a son, Michael Watson happened, Gerald McClellan happened, Nick Blackwell happened, and the many warriors who have fallen or are disabled because of contests in the ring.</p><p>"You cannot come down in weight, especially against a fighter of the magnitude of Mr King, Conor Benn. This ain't no joke."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2019/12/GettyImages-919671028.jpg><p><a href=#>Eubank Jr has since admitted that he found his dad’s attempts to pull him out of his upcoming fight</a> with Conor Benn ‘upsetting.’</p><p>“I can’t have any negative thoughts or worries from any other people affect my mindset and how I will proceed with this fight,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eubank Jr told the Daily Star</a>.</p><p>“He’s my father, he may be worried about me cutting the weight and all the rest of it but I can’t let that affect me and what I want to do. I have to believe in myself.</p><p>“I’m not saying he doesn’t believe in me or believe that I’m going to do it but he’s saying it’s a danger. He probably is right. It is a danger but I’m a dangerous man.”</p><p>He added: “It’s upsetting and sad that he may have those thoughts going through his head, but that’s him.</p><p>“As a man I’ve got to do what I’ve got to do to win and to be able to perform at my best mentally."</p><p>But Eubank Sr has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled down</a> and called for people from the boxing world to boycott the fight.</p><p>Spencer Fearon revealed on his podcast a statement from the boxing legend: “This is what Eubank has said, this is Eubank’s statement, it’s a very simple statement.</p><p>“He said, ‘Dear Spencer, boycott the fight. You know what 3lbs beneath the middleweight limit at 33 years old can do, this is how brain injuries occur.'”</p><h4>Famous reyhdration clauses in boxing</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/96e7fb2f-f145-4555-8390-4e9c6bcc3031.jpg><p><strong>Canelo Alvarez</strong></p><p>The Mexican might be one of the best fighters around but he has a reputation for insisting on rehydration clauses in most of his fights.</p><p>For example, in his fight with Daniel Jacobs in 2019, Jacobs weighed two pounds over the second weigh-in limit and had to pay $1million dollars as a penalty.</p><p>Canelo has won world titles at numerous weights, but this clause is something that has helped him.</p><p>And if heavy financial penalties are agreed upon and it keeps him safer in the ring and earns him some more money, why wouldn't he insist on them?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/02/Image-12.jpeg><p><strong>Amir Khan v Kell Brook</strong></p><p>Before their <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fight earlier this year</a>, Brook and Khan agreed extremely strict rehydration clauses.</p><p>The weight was set at 149lbs, but the catchweight was 163.5lbs, and for every pound over, each fighter would have been fined £100,000.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on talkSPORT">Read More on talkSPORT</h2><p>This was so that neither man would have the advantage over the other because they both believed they were making sacrifices.</p><p>Let us hope we can add Eubank Jr v Benn to this list and the fight goes ahead because it has the potential to be one of the best in recent times.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">OFFER OF THE DAY</h3></p><p>Betway: £30 matched free bet if your first acca loses - <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CLAIM HERE</a></strong></p><p>New UK customers only.
