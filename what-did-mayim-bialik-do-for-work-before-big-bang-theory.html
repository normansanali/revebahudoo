During an appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show, Mayim revealed that she taught sex education to high school students after taking a break from acting.</p><h2 id=mayim-bialik-reveals-her-surprising-job>Mayim Bialik Reveals Her Surprising Job</h2><p>Mayim Bialik explained during her appearance in the show that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she left the entertainment industry</a> after working on Blossom.</p><p>She explained, “I worked on Blossom from the time I was 14 to 19. I left the industry for nine years. I went to college, I went to grad school, I had two kids. So I was like out of the industry and then I came back to the industry and I was in Big Bang Theory.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/XxTFJwJZNqawSN8kMmrPNh.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She added, “But before, I would do the things that people do when they’re in college and grad school.” During her hiatus, Mayim tutored various subjects, including Hebrew and piano. She also tutored high school biology, which included teaching sex education to a group of high school students.</p><p>Surprisingly, Mayim landed a job teaching students about sex education. She said, “I taught in the homeschool community. There’s a Jewish homeschool community that meets in Los Angeles and so many of these kids were raised religious and they never had really any kind of sex ed.”</p><p>According to the actress, many of the students had not received any prior sex education due to their religious upbringing. Despite being recognized by some of their parents as the former star of "Blossom," the students themselves were unaware of her previous career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And they were too young to know me from television.
