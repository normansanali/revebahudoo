He began playing in other nations after a long period in the United States.</p><p>Moreover, he performed in over seven countries and received several awards for his juggling acts. He then decided to reach a wider audience to entertain an increasing number of people.</p><h4><span>Youtube channel</span></h4><p>With this goal in mind, he launched his YouTube channel, ‘@itsalexclark,’ in 2012. Initially, he mainly uploaded stand-up comedy on his YouTube channel.</p><p>Among his many successful stand-up comedies are ‘Grandmother Stabs Granddaughter,’ ‘Naughty Girl Throws Puppy Into River,’ and ‘Top Secret Broadcast.’</p><p>Before releasing animated videos, he wanted to save up enough money to create high-quality animation.</p><p>It took him five years to establish himself as a popular social media performer. He’d already uploaded plenty of ‘Question and Answer’ videos and conducted a meet-and-greet.</p><p>He was inspired to make animated videos after receiving such a positive response at the meet-and-greet event.</p><p>He had a lot of trouble producing animated figures since it took a lot of editing and drawing. As a result, he devised a new technology called motion sketching.</p><p>Initially, he shared a few films created with motion sketching technology. The first video created with this technology was called ‘How to Ask a Girl Out.’</p><p>When this video got popular among his supporters and viewers, Alex began producing a series of films titled ‘About a Girl.’ ‘How I Impressed My Crush,’ ‘Love at First Sight,’ and ‘Cute Notes from Girls’ are just a few of the videos he’s placed under this category.</p><h4><span>Animation and motion sketching films began</span></h4><p>Alex’s mainstream animated videos appeared after he began producing motion sketching films for about a year. ‘Twas the pimp before Christmas,’ is one of his most successful cartoon videos.</p><p>This film was a spoof on how many gifts Santa gives out throughout the Christmas season. Then he made a few videos, like ‘How to Fight: Birth of the Pickle Dipper’ and ‘Okstupid: The Stupid Truth of Internet Dating.’</p><p>He now has his animation studio from which he makes and edits his films. Alex also built a website in an attempt to attract a larger audience.</p><p>This is a collaborative initiative in which his followers may invest and become members of his creative team.</p><p>He also makes his fans happy by giving them attractive prizes from time to time. This increases the number of views and subscribers.</p><p>In addition, he has added a FAQ part, information about his tours, a space for his admirers to demonstrate their skills, and a section where people may post blogs on his website.</p><p>On his YouTube channel, there are more than 4.23 million subscribers with a total of 474,063,883 views.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>In late 2017, he got engaged to his long-time girlfriend <strong>Pam</strong>. Besides that, there is no more information regarding Alex’s past relationship.</p><p>Moreover, this Youtuber is not involved in controversy nor gotten rumors and focuses on his profession and love life.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-201327 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alex-Clark-with-his-girlfreind-Pam.jpg alt="Alex Clark" width=650 height=704 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-201327 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Alex Clark with his girlfriend Pam (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Alex_Clark_8211_Body_Measurements>Alex Clark – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Alex Clark is<strong> 5 feet 6 inches</strong> tall and weighs around 62 kg.
