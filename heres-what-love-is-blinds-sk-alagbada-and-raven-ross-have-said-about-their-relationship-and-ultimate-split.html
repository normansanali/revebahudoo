When Alagbada responded “I don’t” at the season finale, fans assumed that the duo’s relationship had reached its culmination. However, barely a year after their failed nuptials, Alagbada and Ross attended season three’s reunion special, where they announced that they’d <a href=#>rekindled their romance</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, the duo’s reunion was unexpectedly cut short when barely weeks after filming the reunion special, SK got <a href=#>caught up in an embarrassing cheating scandal</a>.
