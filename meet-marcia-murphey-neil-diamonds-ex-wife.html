Marcia, who is currently 83 years old, met her ex-husband during the days of her humble beginnings as a production assistant.</strong></p><p>The couple commenced dating without minding the fact that Diamond was still legally bound to his first wife Jaye Posner. They only waited long enough for the singer’s divorce from Postner to be declared final before they wedded in 1969. Their union, which went on to last for the ensuing 25 years, produced two sons.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Marcia Murphey’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Marcia Murphey</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 1940</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Age:</strong> 83 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey s Husband (Wife):</strong> Diamond Murphey (ex-husband)</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Children:</strong> Two</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Parents:</strong> Franklin Thomas Fox and Gloria Darlene Fox</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Megan Fox</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 7 inches</li><li><strong>Marcia Murphey s Height in Centimetres:</strong> 170 cm</li><li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Being the ex-wife of Diamond Murphey</li></ul><h2><strong>Marcia Murphey is of American Nationality</strong></h2><p>Marcia Murphey’s nationality is captured as American as the former celebrity wife was born in the United States. However, her exact place of birth is not known. Talking about her ethnic background, we were told that she has a mix of English, Scottish, German, Native American French, Irish, Powhatan, and Welsh.</p><p>Marcia is obviously not in the league of celebrity spouses that crave publicity, thus, she has managed to keep vital information about her formative years under wraps. However, it was once revealed that her father goes by the name Franklin Thomas Fox, who earned a living as a parole officer, and her mum’s name is Gloria Darlene Fox; Gloria was a real estate agent.</p><p>Considering the fact that her birth family goes by the last name Fox, then Marcia, whose middle name is Kay had the maiden name Marcia Kay Fox before she changed to Marcia Murphey following her marriage to Diamond Murphey.</p><p>Far from being the only child born to Gloria and Franklin, Marcia shared childhood memories with a younger sister who goes by the name Megan Fox.</p><p>Marcia Murphey’s age has always been a subject of debate as her real date of birth has never been mentioned in public. However, her ex-husband, Diamond Murphey, gave an insight into her age when the music star mentioned that Marcia is two months his senior. Considering the fact that Diamond’s date of birth reads January 24, 1941, then his ex-wife must have been born in 1940, and the month would likely be November.</p><p>Marcia Murphey has not revealed much about her academic journey, but there are sources claiming that she attended high school at St. Lucie West Centennial High School. After she matriculated, the American lady proceeded to the University, though the details of her course of study and year of graduation are not known. People only assumed that she is a college graduate because she worked as a media personality, and it is deemed to be a profession that requires a university degree.</p><h2><strong>Murphey was Once Part of the Media World</strong></h2><p>Because of Marcia Murphey’s penchant for keeping her personal and professional life away from public scrutiny, the American celebrity wife has never talked about her career life in the public space.</p><p>Fans only got to know that she was once a media personality because she was said to be working at a TV station as a production assistant when she first crossed paths with Diamond Murphey; then, she was part of the crew of Clay Cole Show. Fred Weintraubb later hired Murphey’s services on his new series entitled “Live From the Bitter End,” where she worked as a production assistant. However, how long she spent in the positions is not known.</p><p>After she exchanged wedding vows with Diamond, Roy Silver employed Marcia’s services at his Hollywood-based management production company. The former production assistant made a great impression at her new company, as both Silver and other staff members had only good things to say about her.</p><p>Describing Diamond Murphey’s ex-wife, Silver said she is pretty, supper witty, bright, and has the same intellectual capability as the men in the company.</p><p>Comedian Mike Mislove took it to the extreme when the hilarious jester said he was crushing on Marcia Murphey, labeling her a happy-natured person. Marcia’s one-time boyfriend, singer-songwriter Jake Holmes called her gorgeous. On his own part, Stephan Prince said Marcia is a strong and liberated lady, and that he said is among the qualities that made Diamond fall in love with her.</p><p>Diamond’s ex-wife would have been able to add American Civil Liberties Union to her resume, but unfortunately, she had to turn the opportunity to work with the organization down. Her major reason was that she was already a mother of two and needed to spend quality time with her family.</p><h2><strong>Marcia Murphey Met Diamond Murphey While Working at a TV Station</strong></h2><p>It was while Marcia Murphey was working as part of the crew of Clay Cole Show that she saw multiple award-winning musician Diamond Murphey for the first time. When Fred Weintraubb’s “Live From the Bitter End” series hired her services, the duo started seeing more of each other</p><p>Talking about their first meeting, Diamond Murphey said he wasn’t sure what caught his attention when he first set eyes on Marcia and later attributed it to the sadness in her eyes. The American musician described his ex-wife as a lady who obviously understood great pain. The duo didn’t get to talk at the point of their first meeting, however, Marcia, who was already married and divorced, wasn’t deterred to find out that Diamond was a married man and still went ahead to date him.</p><p>Diamond’s first wife, Jaye Posner, was his college sweetheart, and they had already been married for four years, from 1963 to 1967, with two children – Elyn and Marjorie. Finding out all these details didn’t douse Marcia’s interest in the musician one bit, and she patiently waited for Diamond to end things with Jaye before they became officially engaged. The American singer once revealed how he went out for a pack of cigarettes one day and decided never to go back home again, and that marked the end of his first marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/08/R-e1691011683238.jpg><h2><strong>She was Neil Diamond’s Wife for 25 Years</strong></h2><p>After Diamond walked out on his marriage with Jaye in 1967, the couple finalized their divorce a couple of years later in 1969. That same year, Marcia Murphey and her boyfriend, Diamond, exchanged their forever commitment on December 5th, 1969.</p><p>Marcia and Diamond decided to sell the house they were living in after their nuptials. They moved to another plush abode on Malibu beach located up the roadside from the Peters/Streisand summer place.</p><p>While their union lasted, love blossomed between the couple. When Diamond released the hit song “Sweet Caroline,” fans were quick to assume that it was dedicated to President John F. Kennedy’s daughter, Caroline Kennedy. However, Diamond later came up with a clarification saying that he wrote the song for Marcia, but her name didn’t rhyme with the beats, thus, he decided to go with Carolina.</p><p>Talking about the years he spent with Marcia in a 1992 interview session, the American music star admitted that he was not an easy person to cope with, but Marcia was able to handle all his shortcomings for 25 years.</p><p>After 25 long years of marriage, the couple decided to call it quits on their relationship and filed for divorce in 1994.</p><h2><strong>Marcia Murphey and Diamond Murphey Share Two Children</strong></h2><p>Marcia Murphey and her ex-husband Diamond received their first child after being married for two years. The couple’s first son, Jesse Diamond, was born in 1970, however, his exact date of birth is not known.</p><p>Following the birth of their first son, Diamond vowed to Marcia that he would be the best husband and father and spend quality time with her and their kids, something he never did during his first marriage to Jaye.</p><p>Standing by his vows, Diamond cut ties with his professional life and halted all public appearances. For the ensuing four years, the music hitmaker didn’t stage any live performances, rather, he took to fishing and other leisure activities just to be close to his family.</p><p>Jesse Diamond was going to seven years when he became a big brother to the couple’s second son, Micah Diamond, who announced his entrance sometime in 1978.</p><p>By this time, Diamond was already back on the stage, and since 1976 was playing to sell-out crowds, yet, he still gave priority to his family with Marcia Murphey. The popular musician made sure to return home after each tour and was full of praises for the mother of children, describing Marcia as The “rock on which his life is anchored”. Diamond also said Marcia was a whole lot saner than him and helps in keeping his sanity intact.</p><p>Marcia and Diamond don’t just share children, the former couple equally share a grandchild. Their first son Jesse got married to actress Sheryl Lee, and they have a son called Elijah Diamond.</p><p>Diamond and Marcia’s children are obviously fond of their parents and never forget to wish them well on their anniversaries.</p><h2><strong>Why Did Marcia Murphy Divorce Diamond?</strong></h2><p>Following the couple’s divorce, fans of the American music superstar couldn’t hold down their curiosity about what led to their split after 25 together as husband and wife. Diamond let the curiosity simmer for a while before he decided o come up with some insight.</p><p>Going by what the musician said in an interview session, Diamond was the culprit, as he said he stopped paying close attention to the needs of his wife. Diamond’s words were that Marcia did everything right while he did everything wrong.</p><p>Going on, Marcia Murphey’s ex-husband said the split was orchestrated by the brutal consequences of his focus on work. According to Diamond, his professional life changed after he exchanged wedding vows with Marcia, which resulted in him losing a lot of friends and colleagues in the music industry, and the experience hurt him a great deal.</p><p>To date, Diamond still feels guilty about the way his marriage with Marcia turned out. Talking to Dailymail, he said he isn’t really sure about why his marriage had to end after 25 long years. Confessing the love he still felt for Marcia, the singer revealed that the love was overwhelming, and he has continued to harbor feelings for her over the years.</p><p>Talking about their time together, the music superstar said it was wonderful but still went ahead to crush</p><h3><strong>The Marcia Murphey and Diamond Murphey’s Divorce Settlement Sparked a Lot of Talk from Fans</strong></h3><p>With Marcia Murphey and Diamond Murphey’s divorce done and dusted, speculations started making the rounds that Marcie received a whopping $150 million from her ex-husband as a divorce settlement. Soon, different media sources started analyzing her alimony and with time, they came to the conclusion that it merits a spot on the list of the most expensive divorce settlements ever paid in history.</p><p>While all these heated debates were going on, Diamond was still devastated by his divorce and didn’t deem it necessary to come up with a confirmation or rebuttal of the said amount. However, he was able to pick up the pieces of his life together and decided to break his silence about the rumors.</p><p>The American music superstar chose to talk to Dailymail, saying that the amount people were claiming as Marcia Murphey’s alimony didn’t represent the real settlement he made to her. However, Diamond declined to mention exactly how much Marcia received. He only stated that she got enough funds to live a good life even if she never works again, and she was satisfied with what she received.</p><p>On how the initial amount came out, Diamond said it must have been made up by the paparazzi, and in all honesty, he wished he had such an amount to give Marcia as, according to him, she deserves it all; he even disclosed this to his ex. In conclusion, Diamond said musicians don’t earn such huge amounts, which he said can only be made by thieves and businessmen.</p><p>Talking about the undisclosed amount he did pay as alimony, the celebrated musician said he had no qualms about paying out such money because he felt so guilty for how he treated Marcia.</p><h2><strong>Where is Marcia Murphy Now?</strong></h2><p>Being someone that has always avoided the limelight, Marcia didn’t waste any time going back into the shadows after her marriage to Diamond came to an end. With that said, it is rather difficult to say exactly what she is up to.</p><p>However, it is common knowledge that the mother of two still lives in the United States, where she is enjoying life as a grandmother.</p><p>At age 83, Marcia is already an Octogerian and is not expected to be still earning a living. Besides, if what Diamond said is anything to go by, she received enough alimony to take care of her in old age.</p><p>In recent times, Marcia surfaced on her son Jesse’s Instagram handle, where he wished her a “Happy Mother’s Day celebration” in 2022</p><h3><strong>Did Marcia Murphey Remarry?</strong></h3><p>Since she got divorced from Diamond in 1995, Marcia Murphey has not deemed it necessary to go into another relationship, and to date, she never married again.</p><p>However, the same cannot be said about her celebrity ex-husband, who got married seven years later. Diamond’s second wife has been identified as Katie McNeil</p><p>The couple became officially engaged in September 2011, and despite the 30-year-age difference between them, with Diamond as the older one, the lovebirds went on to wed on April 12th, 2012. Their nuptials were hosted in Los Angeles, and Diamond took to Twitter to announce it to fans the next day, describing the moment as magical. The singer has since released an album, Melody Road, which he dedicated to Katie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLqmsdNmpJqqk56ubrnUq6ehnaliu6a1y2abopmdpLulv4yer2avmZuycA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ricardo-quaresma-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ricardo Quaresma Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
