Rumors Explain</h2><p>Many people assumed he was bi when he posted a picture of himself kissing his closest friend, Chase Austin, on the lips in 2017.&nbsp;He ultimately removed the photograph, but many saw it as evidence of his homosexuality.&nbsp;In his post, he underlined that their connection was platonic and that being thus close to someone was not improper.&nbsp;Kiss your friends’ faces more often, and let go of the notion that intimacy is reserved for monogamous partnerships, he said. Be gentler with others. VALUE PLATONIC INTIMACY.</p><p>Accept your vulnerability. Emotionality may be used as a radical strategy to challenge a society that teaches you that expressing emotion is a sign of weakness.&nbsp;The actor has only ever dated women and has never stated his sexual orientation.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurc2aqq2Zo56ubrfAq5inoZukuaK71Kxkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZKutnaS%2FprCMraZmmpVisaLAyKeeZqaflrVur8Snq6KmlaR6pa3ToqWgZZiewLW70bJm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./can-coyotes-jump-fences.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Can Coyotes Jump Fences? | Family Handyman">&larr;
