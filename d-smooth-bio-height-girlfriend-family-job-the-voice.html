He decided to go on this competition to show the world what he has been sharing with Birmingham over the years at smaller venues. And once there, not only did he earn a chair turning from the judges, but also received the Playoff Pass. In the rest of the writing, let us tell you what the pass means, D Smooth journey so far in the competition, and about his life outside of The Voice.</p><h3><strong>D Smooth On The Voice</strong></h3><p>When The Voice dropped its playoffs during its May 1 (2023) episode, D Smooth was introduced as one of the four performers, from none other than Kelly Clarkson’s team.</p><p>During the April 3 episode, when D battled against ALI on Allen Stone’s “Unaware” during the April 3 episode, Chance the Rapper was looking forward to stealing him for his team. And just then Kelly took him to hers instead, using her Playoff Pass. This first-time power ever on the show allowed D to bypass the Knockout Round and go straight to the playoffs.</p><p>“I kinda feel bad because you might want to work with Chance, but I just don’t care. I love you. You have a gift to make it all the way to the finale.” Kelly told D that day.</p><p>Mary Kate Connor from Blake’s team, Ryley Tate Wilson from Niall’s, and Manasseh Samone from Chance were also given the Playoff Pass.</p><p>Among other things, D also thought of participating in <i>Voice </i>to inspire those with dreams of their own.</p><p>D, used to performing Ed Sheeran’s “Perfect” before, sang just that song during his blind audition on this show. About it, D said his nerves were a bit raw as he began. But, any sign of nervousness soon vanished as Kelly turned her chair.</p><p>Ever since, D has been making the most of the opportunity with his vocal coaches, preparing for whatever’s next, one could tell.</p><p>D was not the only singer from Montgomery this season on The Voice. Fifteen-year-old Ryley Tate Wilson, who D refers to as his “Little Bro”, and Jerome Godwin III, 20, both from Team Niall, also have made it through the blind auditions.</p><h3><strong>D Smooth Girlfriend</strong></h3><p>As of May 2023, D Smooth could be found marking his relationship status as a “in a relationship”, on social media. He did not mention though, if or not he continued dating <span><a href=#>N’Dia Givens</a>.</span></p><p>The last time, D gushed about his girlfriend N’Dia on Facebook, it was June of 2020. Before that, D more than once wished her on her birthday on October 3rd. For instance, on that day in 2017, he talked about how he “literally” watched her grow from a little girl to the woman she is today. He gushed that he is beyond blessed to be able to grow with her and called her his “black queen” and “best friend”. A year before, D shared that they have been rocking together since “little youngins”.</p><h3><strong>How Old Is D Smooth?</strong></h3><p>D Smooth turned 25 years old in 2022. The day that happened he took to his social media to gush that he “hit a quarter century”. He said that God has been good to him and his greatness continues to show every year. Also counting his blessings he gushed, “Can’t complain about too much, especially when I know where I come from.”</p><h3><strong>D Smooth Family</strong></h3><p>D Smooth’s dad <a href=#>Anthony Mitchell</a> works in the bakery business, it seems. He turned 53 years old in February 2023. The patriarch, on his Facebook, also mentioned coming from <span>Mulga, Alabama and currently residing in Birmingham, Alabama. In D’s words, his dad is a good person, a hustler, a </span>selfless gentleman, and an even better father. D’s nickname for him is Amp/Peanut/Ant and according to him, his dad has never been absent.</p><p>Then, we have Michelle Berry- Mitchell, D’s very much good and young-appearing mother. She and D’s dad apparently went to the same high school. They were in the Class of 1989.</p><p>D’s mom turned 52 years old in March 2023 and she maybe has had a career as an educator at the Jefferson County Board of Education.</p><p>One more person in D’s family is his sister Breonna Mitchell of Minor, Alabama. She turned 29 years old in June 2022.</p><p>D’s official BIO for The Voice, also tells us that he grew up in the rural countryside and his entire extended family all lived on the same street. In turn, he is said to have always felt blessed that his family was close by to keep him grounded.</p><h3><strong>What Job Does D Smooth Hold?</strong></h3><p>For some time now, D Smooth has quit all his jobs to pursue music full-time. He revealed to the cameras of The Voice that he has found a way to use that to pay his bills.</p><p>He explained that before deciding to go full-time, music was like his “girlfriend” only or like his side piece. But, after that, he said, music has become his wife.</p><p>Speaking of his schooling, D studied at Faulkner University and before that at Minor High School, Adamsville.</p><p>In high school, he was a singer in the jazz band, but his main focus was rather sports.</p><h3><strong>D Smooth Height</strong></h3><p>D Smooth stands above 5 feet and 10 Inches in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is D Smooth Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>D Smooth’s birthday is on September 28th and that makes him a Libra.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is D Smooth From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>D Smooth was born and brought up in Mulga, a town in western Jefferson County, Alabama, in the United States. As of 2023 though, he had been residing in Birmingham of Alabama.</p><p>In between, he also went&nbsp;to Montgomery to attend Faulkner University.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is D Smooth On Instagram And Facebook?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Yes.
