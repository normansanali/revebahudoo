When renting a wrecker, be prepared to spend at least $100 per day for the privilege of doing so. With mileage often costing 50 cents per mile and, of course, insurance, your daily rental will cost roughly $200 to $300 per day or more, depending on the size of the rig you are looking for.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-146 data-inserter-version=2></span><h3>People also inquire about the cost of renting a flatbed, which is a common question.</h3><p>Anyone would prefer that their expenses do not outweigh their profit margins. Purchasing a flatbed trailer may cost between $40000 and $50000, or even more depending on the size of the vehicle, whilst renting one can cost between $50 and $100 each day depending on the size of the truck. A day rental may be obtained for as little as $45.</p><h3>Furthermore, do you provide tow truck rentals?</h3><p>&nbsp;When you hire a tow dolly or car carrier from us, you can be certain that your vehicle will arrive at its new location securely. Before placing your car into your Penske rental truck, make sure the towing device is connected to the truck.
