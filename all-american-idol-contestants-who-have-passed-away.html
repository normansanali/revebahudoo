Here’s a bleak but straightforward look at every contestant in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol history</a> who’s passed away.</p><h2 id=h-michael-johns data-injectable=false>Michael Johns</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false>The very first American Idol contestant to pass away, Michael Johns appeared on the reality series during the 2007-2008 season, doing well enough that he made it into the year’s Top 8 contestants. Six years after the finale, after experiencing some mild success as a recording artist, he died as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy and liver damage. The Australian singer was 34.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>CJ Harris</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Rushed to a hospital in his home town of Jasper, Alabama on January 15, 2023, 31-year-old American Idol contestant C.J. Harris did not respond to attempts by doctors to perform CPR. After nation-wide tours and performances in some of the most iconic venues in America, the sixth-place finisher was pronounced dead, with Deadline later reporting his cause of death as a massive heart attack.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Willie Spence</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Willie Spence made waves as American Idol’s season 19 runner-up at just 22 years old, shattering the judges’ expectations during his audition. The next year, in October of 2021, Spence was involved in a vehicle collision in Tennessee’s Marion County, veering off the road and into the back of a tractor trailer. The 23-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Nikki McKibbin</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Finishing in third place during the very first season of American Idol, Nikki McKibbin was part of a unique club. Sadly, fame never seemed to stick to her the way that it did with first and second-place winners <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Clarkson</a> and Justin Guarini, and she struggled both with finding a professional foothold, and issues with sobriety. On November 1, 2020, she passed away after suffering a brain aneurysm four days earlier. She was 42.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Haley Smith</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=true>After a brief but memorable audition during American Idol’s 11th season, Haley Smith was sent home. Seven years later, she was riding her motorcycle in Millinocket, Maine late at night in early September of 2019 when she lost control of the vehicle, crashing.

Both LaBelle and Butler were later found to have had amphetamines, painkillers, and alcohol in their systems when Butler, driving more than twice the speed limit, careened into a stripmall parking lot, flipped the car two times. Both were pronounced dead at the scene owing to multiple traumatic injuries. Butler was 38 at the time of his death, and LaBelle was 31.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Rickey Smith</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>At around 3 in the morning on Friday, May 6, 2016, 36-year-old American Idol finalist Rickey Smith was driving on the highway outside of Oklahoma City when a pickup truck struck him head-on driving the wrong way.

He was 34.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Joanne Borgella</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=false>In October of 2013, American Idol contestant Joanne Borgella announced on social media that, following a series of severe headaches, she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer that had spread to her brain.
