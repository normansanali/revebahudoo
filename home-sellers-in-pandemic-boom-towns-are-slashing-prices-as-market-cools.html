the analysis had fewer than 15 percent of home listings that were reduced from their initial asking price.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>More than half of the cities with the biggest share of price drops–Boise, Denver, Tacoma, Sacramento, Phoenix, San Diego and Portland–were among the 20 housing markets that cooled fastest in the first half of 2022.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Redfin notes those markets had attracted scores of eager homebuyers during the pandemic, when tech workers and other white collar workers fled more expensive markets and drove home prices up in smaller
