Where is Duke Dennis from in South Carolina?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Duke Dennis is a YouTube content creator and social media influencer who is growing his following in the super-popular game franchise, NBA 2K.</p><p>With more than a million subscribers on the video streaming platform and a small—but growing—audience across the other social media platforms that matter, Duke Dennis may be on to something.</p><p>But does he have what it takes to stand out in the crowd of gamer influencers and NBA 2K fans?</p><p>Here’s what we know.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Duke Dennis was born on the 26th of February, 1994.</p><p>The Southern boy was raised in Greenville, South Carolina, by a single mom.</p><p>He has said in the past that he didn’t have a dad “to say happy Father’s Day to” but he credits his mom as always being there for him and teaching him how to be a man.</p><p>Dennis loved sports in high school and excelled at American football.</p><p>He received a few offers to play football at small community colleges, but there were just two problems with that plan: he didn’t want to play football anymore, and he didn’t want to go to college.</p><p>Dealing with his mother’s disappointment at his lack of ambition was one thing.</p><p>Growing up in what Dennis described as “the hood,” he felt that his options were limited.</p><p>Knowing that he needed to get out soon if he was to make something of himself, a 17-year-old Duke made a pact with one of his buddies: if neither of them had plans when they graduated high school, they’d join the army together.</p><p>And so it began.</p><h2><strong>Have You Got What It Takes?</strong></h2><p><br>As it turns out, the answer to that question for Duke Dennis was a resounding ‘No.’</p><p>He and his friend joined the army and left South Carolina for basic training on December 31st, 2012.</p><p>Dennis had never been away from home and never been away from his mom, his family, or his friends for any length of time.</p><p>He says it was cold, he was sad, and he was lonely.</p><p>On his very first day on a US Army base, he was assigned to a Reception Battalion for onboarding.</p><p>The idea was simple: paperwork, vaccinations, uniforms, haircuts, and induction into army life.</p><p>Duke admits that he knew at that point—on day 1, no less—that he had made the wrong decision.</p><p>He called his mom and said, “I don’t know what I got myself into.”</p><p>He wanted to quit—or get kicked out—and go home to his mother.</p><p>He hated his army-issue haircut and uniform, he didn’t want to wake up at 5 am for drills, and he didn’t want to be told what to do.</p><p>His mom cut straight to the point.</p><p>She told him to man up and “do what he gotta do,” according to Dennis.</p><p>She explained that worst case scenario, he’d be home in a couple of months and that this time would be good for him because he had absolutely nothing else planned for his future.</p><p>Dennis was homesick, but he scraped through basic training—which he described as a nightmare.</p><p>His fitness was sub-par, his discipline was non-existent, and his attitude—according to him—was terrible.</p><p>At the end of basic training he called to complain to his girlfriend about his ordeal—only to find out she’d cheated on him.</p><p>Sullen, heartbroken, and still not committed to the army but with nowhere else to go, Dennis was shipped off to Germany to start his US Army career.</p><p>He was mad, and complained in a video that the army “did him dirty” by sending him there.</p><p>He stayed in his room a lot, sulked a lot, and called his mom to tell her again that he couldn’t take it.</p><p>Dennis’ complaints about the career path he’d chosen were almost endless—from the haircut and the discipline, to the routine, to “not finishing work until 5 or 6 in the afternoon,” he also took issue with “booty shorts” and running in the cold.</p><p>His mom didn’t support his plan to get kicked out, but Dennis had had enough.</p><p>Not wanting to deal with the issue directly, he hid under his desk one day to nap.</p><p>While other army staffers were searching for him, he snuck out and ran back to his room.</p><p>His First Sergeant called him into his office to ask what had happened.</p><p>He lied about where he’d been, and the First Sergeant gave him the opportunity he wanted.</p><p>According to Dennis, he said, “If you don’t want to be here, let me know.” Dennis let him know.</p><p>After 4 years, Dennis was out of the army with nothing to show for it except a story he could share on YouTube.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>BigDawsTV & Kelly Cecil</a></p><h2><strong>Finding His Calling</strong></h2><p><br>At a loose end and home in the South, Dennis went back to playing video games.</p><p>In 2017. he uploaded one called “Angry trash talker” and followed it up with several more.</p><p>His following grew steadily, as subscribers came to enjoy his brash, outspoken personality and high energy.</p><p>Most of his content centers around NBA 2K gameplay, although Duke also does collaborations and prank videos.</p><p>The videos that have
