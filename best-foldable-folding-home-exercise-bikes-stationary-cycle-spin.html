We just think that should be acknowledged, openly, more often. We already dreaded the gym (and its expensive memberships), and this past year has made it even harder. At home, however, we feel pretty limited with our workouts. We’re also not getting outside for more casual exercise the way we used to.</p><p>One form of exercise more and more people are turning to is the stationary bike. Cycling, spinning, casual pedaling — all of the above can make a major difference in your life and health. Plus, as <strong>Kim Eskola</strong>, MS, told <a href=# rel=noopener>WebMD</a>, “A stationary bike is very easy on the joints” and is easier to use compared to other popular exercise machines and devices. The article also brings up how it can be used regardless of the outside weather, you don’t have to leave your home to use it, you can watch TV while using it and you can use it any time of day. And if you have one that folds up? You can hide/store it away with ease! That’s why we made a list of the best foldable exercise bicycles for you to check out!</p><h3>3 Quick Picks:</h3><p>Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, February 26, 2021, but are subject to change.</p><h3>How to Choose a Folding Exercise Bike — 5 Things to Consider</h3><ul><li>Where it will go in your home. Choose a designated spot for both use and storage beforehand, and make sure the exercise bike you pick is small enough fit in both!</li><li>Resistance. If you’re looking to do cycling classes or add a little more challenge to your workout, you’re going to want a bike with an easy-to-use resistance knob.</li><li>Noise. How important is it that the bike is quiet? Do you like a little noise to get you in the zone, or do you prefer to work out silently while others are sleeping?</li><li>Brand and price. How important is it that you buy a known brand? Is it worth shelling out the money, or is the logo the only difference?</li><li>Comfort. Riding an exercise bike can hurt! How much will you be sitting versus standing? Some bikes have bigger, more comfortable seats, while others have skinny, hard-as-rock seats.</li></ul><h3>11 of the Best Folding Exercise Bikes</h3><h4>Best lightweight exercise bike: leikefitness LEIKE X Bike Ultra-Quiet Folding Exercise Bike</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/best-folding-exercise-bike-lightweight.jpg><p>Some of even the simplest exercise bikes weigh 50+ or even 100+ pounds, but this folding one is just 38.5 pounds!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">leikefitness LEIKE X Bike Ultra-Quiet Folding Exercise Bike</a> (originally $199)&nbsp;for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$190</a> at Amazon!
