Olivia, who was riding off of the success of Disney Channel's <a href=#>High School Musical: The Musical: The Series</a>, was just getting started in the music business and had been very open about her admiration of Taylor.</p><p>And in the beginning, Taylor seemed fond of Olivia, too.</p><p>When Olivia posted a video of her singing Taylor's song "Cruel Summer," Taylor reacted by posting Olivia's cover on her Instagram Story.</p><p>"Love this!" Taylor wrote in response. Naturally, the then-16-year-old was over the moon that her favorite songstress had not just noticed her, but complimented her singing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I AM GONNA FRAME THIS SCREENSHOT AND HANG IT ABOVE MY FIRSTBORN’S CRIB <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/JQwlR1CXws</a></p>— Olivia Rodrigo (@oliviarodrigo) <a href=#>April 23, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">January 2021: Olivia releases her debut record-breaking single "Driver License."</h2><p>On Jan. 8, 2021, Olivia released her debut single <a href=#>"Driver's License,"</a> and the world was shaken by her talent. Within hours, the single was at No. 3 on Top 100: USA chart on iTunes.</p><p>Olivia shared the good news on Instagram, but not without acknowledging the two singles ahead of hers. "Next to Taylor on the US iTunes chart. I’m in a puddle of tears," she wrote.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Rodrigo (@oliviarodrigo)</a></p></figure><p>The following day, Olivia snagged the top spot on the charts, knocking Taylor out of the lead.</p><p>On Jan. 10, Taylor responded to Olivia's Instagram post about placing on the iTunes chart and wrote: "I say that's my baby and I'm really proud," followed by a happy crying emoji, a heart emoji, and a clapping hands emoji.</p><p>Olivia, once again Olivia was overwhelmed by Taylor's support and shared a video of her reacting to Taylor's comment.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Rodrigo (@oliviarodrigo)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">February 2021: Olivia claims she's "the world's biggest Swiftie" in an interview.</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nylon</a>, the rising starlet gushed over Taylor, sharing a memory of when she was 4 years old and belted out her song “Picture to Burn." Olivia also dubbed herself “the world’s biggest Swiftie.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">May 2021: Olivia and Taylor meet at the BRIT awards. Olivia's first album 'Sour' is released.</h2><p>On May 11, 2021, Olivia and Taylor finally met in person at the BRIT Awards and took <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this photo</a> together backstage. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Olivia passed Taylor a sweet handwritten note that night, too. The ladies still seemed to be smitten with one another.</p><p>Later that month, Olivia's debut album "Sour" was released on May 21.</p><p>And fans learned that Taylor and her longtime writing partner <a href=#>Jack Antonoff</a> had actually gotten a writing credit on one of Olivia's tracks.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Olivia discussed why they received credits on the song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" while on The Zach Sang Show on May 30, 2021.</p><p>"We interpolated ‘New Year’s Day,’ which is Taylor’s song from 'Reputation.' I came up with the '1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back"' concept and I sort of wrote a verse and a chorus," she said.</p><p>This basically meant that Olivia inserted chords from "New Year's Day" into "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back." This is different from sampling as Olivia re-recorded the chords in a toned-down manner so they would sound similar to Taylor's, but weren't identical.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">July 2021: Taylor and songwriting partner Jack Antonoff quietly receive writing credits on "Deja Vu" after a rumored lawsuit.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>why does deja vu by olivia rodrigo sound exactly like cruel summer by taylor swift</p>— 🌸 (@imjustheregh) <a href=#>April 1, 2021</a></figure><p>In the weeks following Olivia's release of "Sour," fans started pointing out that there were similarities between Olivia's song "Deja Vu" and Taylor's song "Cruel Summer."</p><p>While Taylor and Jack already received credit on "Sour" for "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back," it appeared that they also believed they deserved credit on "Deja Vu" and accused Olivia of copyright infringement. Rumors circulated that <a href=#>Taylor actually sued Olivia over this</a>, but that has never been confirmed.</p><p>In July 2021, Olivia quietly gave Taylor and Jack writing credits for "Deja Vu."</p><p>The following month, <a href=#>Paramore</a> lead singer Hayley Williams, who is friends with Taylor, and her bandmate Josh Farro received credit on Olivia's song "Good 4 U." This came after months of people comparing Olivia's song "Good 4 U" to Paramore's "Misery Business."</p><p>Ultimately, Olivia lost millions of dollars paying out royalties to Taylor and Paramore — which likely felt like a major blow after working so hard to put out her first album. It was unclear why Taylor was so adamant about getting credit.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>i heard taylor swift sued her? or at least accused her of copyright infringement? not sure how true it is… but if so, that might be why olivia distanced herself</p>— c e e⚡️ (@midnight_hoax) <a href=#>August 14, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">December 2021: Olivia is named 'Time' magazine's "Entertainer of the Year."</h2><p>In December 2021, Olivia was named "Entertainer of the Year" by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time</a>. In her interview with the publication, she spoke about the plagiarism accusations that surrounded her first album, claiming, “It was really frustrating to see people discredit and deny my creativity."</p><p>Record producer and songwriter Dan Nigro, who has been working with Olivia since the get-go, also shared his thoughts. “It seems like people get funny about things when songs become really popular," he said.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span><p>Dan Nigro and Olivia Rodrigo posing with their Grammy at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">June 2023: Olivia releases "Vampire" and fans begin speculating over who it is about.

However, sources confirmed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> that it was about someone else, which quickly made some turn their attention to Taylor.</p><p>That same month, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor added</a> singer <a href=#>Sabrina Carpenter</a> to her <a href=#>Eras tour</a> lineup for Europe as a special guest. This raised brows as Sabrina is believed to be the woman that Olivia's ex <a href=#>Joshua Basset</a> left her for, as detailed in "Driver's License."
